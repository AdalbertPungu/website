# Documentation Sitemap Guide

This guide is a short reference for where information should fit into the documentation.
Top-level items are all categories that users need to be able to access at a glance. All navigation bar items should be sentence-cased, so words should be capitalized, except for articles like "a", "with" and "an".

## Overview

This should include information necessary for users to start using Neon, currently including pages like `What is Neon` and other pages that get a user started using Neon. This item should include very basic important information.

## Integrations

This section is for the various Neon integrations, mostly split into two sections `Cloud Deployments` and `Frameworks and Programming Languages` based on common characteristics. Items that don't fit into existing sub-categories can be added as siblings to the existing categories. If a third subcategory is appropriate and has 3 or more pages to add to it, it would be a good idea to add a subcategory here.

## How-to Guides

This section should have brief guides on how to accomplish specific goals, for example, `Importing an Existing Database`, `Connecting with Legacy Clients` and other specific goals should go here.

## Reference

This should contain pages with specific technical information. This can mean definitions in the `Glossary`, the `Neon Roadmap`, or information about the limitations and capabilities of Neon.

Items here should have a narrower scope than the `Conceptual Guides` and avoid focusing on features. The rule-of-thumb for pages here should be information that users would want to look up quickly, like the current version of third-party libraries, default parameters, or default size and speed limits.

## Conceptual Guides

These should all be descriptions of Neon features and how they work. If Neon has a novel or unique approach to a common feature, that can also be described here.

## Security

This can be expanded to have more articles about how Neon handles security in the future.

## Release Notes

While it is ideal for all top-level items to have multiple sub-items that fall under them, this section is an exception. A single release notes page is easier to maintain long-term and easier to find here rather than under the `Reference` item.
