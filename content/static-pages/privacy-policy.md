## 1. Information we collect

When you contact us or interact with our Service we collect information that alone or in combination with other information could be used to identify you (“**Personal Data**”) as follows:

**Personal Data You Provide**: We collect Personal Data when you contact us or visit the Sites. The Personal Data collected during these interactions may vary based on what you choose to share with us, but it will generally include name and email address.

**Personal Data We Collect Through Our Social Media Pages**: We have pages on social media sites like Twitter and LinkedIn (“**Social Media Pages**”). When you interact with our Social Media Pages, we will collect Personal Data that you elect to provide to us as indicated by your settings, such as your contact details. In addition, the companies that host our Social Media Pages and Community Pages may provide us with aggregate information and analytics regarding the use of those pages. When you interact with our Social Media Pages, you are agreeing to abide by the applicable terms and policies of the third parties providing those pages and you recognize that Neon does not control, and is not responsible for, how such third parties may use your Personal Data.

**Personal Data We Receive Automatically From Your Use of the Sites**: When you visit, use and interact with the Sites, we may receive certain information about your visit, use or interactions. For example, we may monitor the number of people that visit our Sites, peak hours of visits, which page(s) are visited on our Sites, the domains our visitors come from (e.g., google.com, yahoo.com, etc.), and which browsers people use to access and visit our Sites (e.g., Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, etc.), broad geographical information, and Site-navigation pattern. In particular, the following information is created and automatically logged in our systems:

- **Log data**: Information that your browser automatically sends whenever you visit the Sites (“log data”). Log data includes your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (so we understand which country you are connecting from when you visit the Sites), browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, and how you interacted with the Sites.

**Online Tracking and Do Not Track Signals**: We may, and we may allow third party service providers to, use cookies or other tracking technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites following your use of the Sites. Our Sites currently does not respond to “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signals and operates as described in this Privacy Policy whether or not a DNT signal is received. If we do respond to DNT signals in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy.

## 2. How we use personal data

We use Personal Data to provide the Service. This processing is necessary to perform our contract with you.

We also use Personal Data as necessary for the following legitimate business interests:

- To respond to your inquiries, comments, feedback or questions;
- To manage our relationship with you, which includes sending administrative information to you relating to our Service and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies, and asking you to leave a review or take a survey;
- To analyze how you interact with our Service, including the pages you visit and the links you click, so we can provide, maintain and improve the content and functionality of the Service and our customer relationships and experiences, develop our business and inform our marketing strategy (please see the “[Cookies](#cookies)” section below to learn how we use cookies);
- To administer and protect our business and the Sites, prevent fraud, criminal activity, or misuses of our Sites, and to ensure the security of our IT systems, architecture and networks (including troubleshooting, testing, system maintenance, support and hosting of data);

For information about what we mean by legitimate interests and the rights of individuals in the European Union (“EU”), please see the “[EU Users](#eu-users)” section below.

**Marketing**. We may contact you to provide information we believe will be of interest to you. For instance, if you elect to provide your email address, we may use that information to send you promotional information about our products and services. If we do, where required by law, for example if you are in the EU, we will only send you such emails if you consent to us doing so at the time you provide us with your Personal Data. You may opt out of receiving emails by following the instructions contained in each promotional email we send you or by [contacting us](#contact-us). If you unsubscribe from our marketing lists, you will no longer receive marketing communications but we will continue to contact you regarding our Sites and Services and to respond to your requests.

## 3. How we share and disclose personal data

In certain circumstances we may share your Personal Data with third parties without further notice to you, unless required by the law, as set forth below:

- **Vendors and Service Providers**: To assist us in meeting business operations needs and to perform certain services and functions, we may share Personal Data with service providers, including hosting, cloud services and other information technology services providers; email communication software providers and email newsletter providers; data base and sales/customer relationship management services; payment processors; and web analytics services. Pursuant to our instructions, these parties will access, process or store Personal Data in the course of performing their duties to us.
- **Business Transfers**: If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of all or a portion of our assets, or transition of service to another provider, your Personal Data and other information may be shared in the diligence process with counterparties and others assisting with the transaction and transferred to a successor or affiliate as part of that transaction along with other assets.
- **Legal Requirements**: If required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with legal or regulatory obligations, including to respond to lawful requests from public authorities and to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, (ii) protect and defend our rights or property, (iii) prevent fraud, (iv) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Sites, or the public, or (v) protect against legal liability.

## 4. Data retention

We keep Personal Data for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, while we have a legitimate business need to do so, or as required by law (e.g. for tax, legal, accounting or other purposes), whichever is the longer.

If you have elected to receive marketing communications from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences until you opt out of receiving these communications and in accordance with our policies.

To determine the appropriate retention period for your Personal Data, we will consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we use your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
