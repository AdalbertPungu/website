Thank you for entrusting Neon with your source code, projects, and personal information. Ensuring the security of your private information is a serious matter, and we want you to know how we manage that responsibility.

It also sets out more information about your privacy rights.

## Guiding Principles

### What Information Neon Collects and Why

#### Information From Website Browsers

We use common internet technologies, such as cookies and web server logs, to collect data for all visitors accessing neon owned domains.

The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes the visitor’s browser type, language preference, referring site, additional websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request. We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

#### Why Do We Collect This?

We collect this information to better understand how visitors to our website use Neon, and to monitor and protect the security of the website.

#### Information From Users With Accounts

If you create an account, we require some basic information at the time of account creation. You will provide a user name and password, and we will ask you for a valid email address. You also have the option to give us more information if you want to, and this may include "User Personal Information."

"User Personal Information" is any information about a user which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify the user. Information such as a user name and password, an email address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of “User Personal Information.”

User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information. We may use aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, improve, and optimize our website and service.

#### Why Do We Collect This?

- We need your User Personal Information to create your account, and to provide the services you request.
- We use your User Personal Information, specifically your user name and email address, to identify you on Neon.
- We use your email address to communicate with you, if you have consented to this use for the purposes outlined in our [email communication section](#contacting-neon).
- We limit our use of your User Personal Information to the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy. If we need to use your
- User Personal Information for other purposes, we will ask for your permission first.

#### What Information Neon Does Not Collect

We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious affiliation. Although Neon does not request or intentionally collect sensitive personal information, we realize that you might store this kind of information in your account, such as in an application. If you store sensitive personal information on our servers, you are consenting to our storage of that information on our servers, which are located in the regions list [here](https://neon.tech/docs/conceptual-guides/regions/).

You shall be responsible for ensuring that any Sensitive Information is Transferred to the Neon Product in compliance with any applicable Data Protection Laws as defined in the Terms. You shall be solely liable for any and all liabilities arising from or relating to your Sensitive Information. We do not allow Transferring of the Sensitive Information during the Technical Previews.

We do not intentionally collect information that is stored in your applications or other free-form content inputs. Information in your applications belongs to you, and you are responsible for it, as well as for making sure that your content complies with our [Terms of Service](/terms-of-service). Neon employees do not access applications or your Personal Information unless required to for security or maintenance, or for support reasons. If Neon employees will access your applications for the security reasons, we will try all the best efforts to get your consent otherwise we will notify the application owner of any technical incident or security issue that led to access of their application.

If you are a minor under the age of 16, you are not permitted to have an account on Neon. Neon does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 16. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 16, we will unfortunately have to close your account. Please see our [Terms of Service](/terms-of-service) for information about account termination.

#### How We Share the Information We Collect

We do not share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with third parties for commercial purposes.
We do not disclose User Personal Information outside Neon, except in the situations listed in this section or in the section below.

#### How We Respond to Compelled Disclosure

We do share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, collectively, use Neon, or how our users respond to our other offerings, such as our conferences or events. For example, we may compile statistics on the usage of HTTP content types across Neon. However, we do not sell this information to advertisers or marketers.

We do not host advertising on Neon. We may occasionally embed content from third party sites, such as YouTube, and that content may include ads.

We may share User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have requested.
We may share User Personal Information with a limited number of third-party vendors who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to our own Privacy Policy. Our vendors perform services such as payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, and other similar services.

We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition. If any such change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of User Personal Information, and we will notify you on our website or by email before any transfer of your User Personal Information. The organization receiving any User Personal Information will have to honor any promises we have made in our Privacy Policy or in our [Terms of Service](/terms-of-service).

### Our Use of Cookies and Tracking

#### Cookies

Neon uses cookies to make interactions with our service easy and meaningful. We use cookies (and similar technologies, like HTML5 localStorage) to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and provide information for future development of Neon.

A cookie is a small piece of text that our web server stores on your computer or mobile device, which your browser sends to us when you return to our site. Cookies do not necessarily identify you if you are merely visiting Neon; however, a cookie may store a unique identifier for each logged in user. The cookies Neon sets are essential for the operation of the website, or are used for performance or functionality. By using our website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device. If you disable your browser or device’s ability to accept cookies, you will not be able to log in or use Neon’s services.

#### Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics as a third party tracking service, but we don’t use it to track you individually or collect your User Personal Information. We use Google Analytics to collect information about how our website performs and how our users, in general, navigate through and use Neon. This helps us evaluate our users' use of Neon, compile statistical reports on activity, and improve our content and website performance.

Google Analytics gathers certain simple, non-personally identifying information over time, such as your IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages, time stamp, and similar data about your use of Neon. We do not link this information to any of your personal information such as your user name.

Neon will not, nor will we allow any third party to, use the Google Analytics tool to track our users individually; collect any User Personal Information other than IP address; or correlate your IP address with your identity. Google provides further information about its own privacy practices and offers a [browser add-on to opt out of Google Analytics tracking](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

Certain pages on our site may set other third party cookies. For example, we may embed content, such as videos, from another site that sets a cookie. While we try to minimize these third party cookies, we can’t always control what cookies this third party content sets.

#### Tracking

["Do Not Track"](http://donottrack.us/) is a privacy preference you can set in your browser if you do not want online services to collect and share certain kinds of information about your online activity from third party tracking services. We do not track your online browsing activity on other online services over time and we do not permit third-party services to track your activity on our site beyond our basic Google Analytics tracking, which you may opt out of [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). Because we do not share this kind of data with third party services or permit this kind of third party data collection on Neon for any of our users, and we do not track our users on third-party websites ourselves, we do not need to respond differently to an individual browser's Do Not Track setting.

If you are interested in turning on your browser’s privacy and Do Not Track settings, the [Do Not Track](http://donottrack.us/) website has browser-specific instructions.

Please see our section on [email communication](https://fly.io/legal/privacy-policy/#how-we-communicate-with-you) to learn about our use of pixel tags in marketing emails.

#### How Neon Secures Your Information

Neon takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect User Personal Information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of User Personal Information. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

Neon is currently in Technical Preview means that our information security practices are constantly being improved to meet best industry practices, however, some deviations may occur.  No method of transmission, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot offer a guarantee of absolute security. For more information, see our [security page](https://neon.tech/docs/security/).

#### Resolving Complaints

If you have concerns about the way Neon is handling your User Personal Information, please let us know immediately. We want to help. You may email us directly at privacy@neon.tech with the subject line "Privacy Concerns." We will respond within 45 days at the latest.

#### How We Respond to Compelled Disclosure

Neon may disclose personally-identifying information or other information we collect about you to law enforcement in response to a valid subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large.

In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, Neon strives for transparency. When permitted, we will make a reasonable effort to notify users of any disclosure of their information, unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so, or in rare, exigent circumstances.

#### How You Can Access and Control the Information We Collect

If you are already a Neon user, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by editing your user profile or contacting [email](support@neon.tech).

#### Data Retention and Deletion

Neon will retain User Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.
We may retain certain User Personal Information indefinitely, unless you delete it or request its deletion. For example, we do not automatically delete inactive user accounts, so unless you choose to delete your account, we will retain your account information indefinitely.

If you would like to cancel your account or delete your User Personal Information, you may do so by emailing support@neon.tech. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile (within reason) within 30 days.

#### How We Communicate With You

We will use your email address to communicate with you. You have control over how your email address is used and shared by Neon.

Depending on your email settings, Neon may occasionally send notification emails about new features, requests for feedback, important policy changes, or customer support offers. We also send marketing emails, but only with your consent. There is an unsubscribe link located at the bottom of the emails we send you.

Our emails might contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that tells us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use the pixel tag to make our email more effective for you and to make sure we are not sending you unwanted content. If you prefer not to receive pixel tags, please opt out of our marketing emails.

#### Changes to Our Privacy Policy

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Neon may change our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will provide notification to users of material changes to this Privacy Policy through our Website by posting a notice on our home page. For changes to this Privacy Policy that do not affect your rights, we encourage visitors to check this page frequently.
