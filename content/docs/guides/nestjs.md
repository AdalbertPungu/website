Nest.js is a progressive, TypeScript-based Node.js framework designed for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable server-side applications. Drawing inspiration from the Angular architecture, Nest.js promotes a modular structure, dependency injection, and the use of decorators, fostering a clean and organized codebase. With its extensibility, testability, and compatibility with numerous libraries and tools, Nest.js offers a modern and streamlined approach to web application development.

TypeORM is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for TypeScript and JavaScript that simplifies the interaction between your application and databases.TypeORM allows developers to work with databases using a more object-oriented and type-safe approach, abstracting the complexities of raw SQL queries and manual data mapping.
