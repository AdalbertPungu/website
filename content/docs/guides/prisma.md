Prisma is an open-source, next-generation ORM that allows you to easily manage and interact with your database. This guide describes how to connect to Neon from Prisma.

## Create a Neon project

If you do not have one already, create a Neon project. Save your connection connection string. It is required when defining connection settings.

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify a name, a PostgreSQL version, a region, and click **Create Project**.

## Connect to Neon from Prisma

To connect to Neon from Prisma:

1. Add the following lines to your `prisma/schema.prisma` file to identify the data source and database URL:

   ```typescript
   datasource db {
     provider = "postgresql"
     url   = env("DATABASE_URL")
   }
   ```

2. Add a `DATABASE_URL` setting to your `.env` file and set it to the Neon connection string that you copied in the previous step.

  ```shell
  DATABASE_URL="postgres://<user>:<password>@<endpoint_hostname>:5432/neondb"
  ```

where:

- `<endpoint_hostname>` the hostname of the branch endpoint. The endpoint hostname has an `ep-` prefix and appears similar to this: `ep-tight-salad-272396.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`.
- `<user>` is the database user.
- `<password>` is the database user's password, which is provided to you when you create a Neon project.

You can find all of the connection details listed above, except for your password,  in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. For more information, see [Connect from any application](../../connect/connect-from-any-app). If you have misplaced your password, see [Reset a password](../../manage/users/#reset-a-password).

## Configure a shadow database for Prisma Migrate

Prisma Migrate is a migration tool that allows you to easily evolve your database schema from prototyping to production. Prisma Migrate requires a shadow database to detect schema drift. This section describes how to configure a second Neon database as a shadow database, which is required to run the `prisma migrate dev` command.

<Admonition type="note">
Prisma Migrate requires a direct connection to the database and currently does not support connection pooling with PgBouncer. Migrations fail with an error if connection pooling is enabled in Neon. For more information, see [Prisma Migrate and with PgBouncer](../prisma-connection-issues/#prisma-migrate-with-pgbouncer).
</Admonition>

To configure a shadow database:

1. Create another database in your Neon project and copy the connection string. Refer to [Create a database](../../manage/databases/#create-a-database) for instructions. For information about obtaining a connection string, see [Connect from any application](../../connect/connect-from-any-app/).

1. Add the `shadowDatabaseUrl` setting to your `prisma/schema.prisma` file to identify the shadow database URL:

   ```typescript
   datasource db {
     provider = "postgresql"
     url   = env("DATABASE_URL")
     shadowDatabaseUrl = env("SHADOW_DATABASE_URL")
   }
   ```

1. Add a `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL` setting to your `.env` file and set it to the Neon connection string that you copied in the previous step.

   ```shell
   SHADOW_DATABASE_URL="postgres://<user>:<password>@<endpoint_hostname>:5432/<dbname>"
   ```

For additional information about shadow databases, refer to [About the shadow database](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/shadow-database), in the _Prisma documentation_.


## Using Prisma Migrate with PgBouncer

Prisma Migrate requires a direct connection to the database and currently does not support connection pooling with PgBouncer. Attempting to run Prisma Migrate commands in an environment that enables PgBouncer for connection pooling results in the following error:

```text
Error: undefined: Database error
Error querying the database: db error: ERROR: prepared statement 
"s0" already exists
```

If you encounter this error, ensure that connection pooling in Neon is disabled. See [Enable connection pooling](../../connect/connection-pooling/#enable-connection-pooling).

For more information about this issue, refer to the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/performance-and-optimization/connection-management/configure-pg-bouncer#prisma-migrate-and-pgbouncer-workaround).

## Using Prisma Client from serverless functions

Using Prisma Client from a serverless function may require adding the `?pgbouncer=true` flag to your connection URL to enable connection pooling, as serverless function may require a large number of database connections.

PGBouncer is enabled by adding the `?pgbouncer=true` flag to your connection URL. For example:

```text
postgres://<user>:<password>@<endpoint_hostname>:5432/neondb?pgbouncer=true
```

For more information, refer to the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/performance-and-optimization/connection-management/configure-pg-bouncer#add-pgbouncer-to-the-connection-url).

<Admonition type="note">
PgBouncer is not compatible with Prisma Migrate, which requires a direct connection to the database, which means that you cannot enable connection pooling in Neon if if you intend to use the same connection for Prisma Migrate. See [Using Prisma Migrate with PgBouncer](#using-prisma-migrate-with-pgbouncer).

## Connection issues

A connection timeout when attempting to connect to Prisma from Neon results in the following error:

```text
Error: P1001: Can't reach database server at `ep-white-thunder-826300.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`:`5432`
Please make sure your database server is running at `ep-white-thunder-826300.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`:`5432`.
```

A compute node in Neon has two main states: Active and Idle.

Active means that PostgreSQL is currently running. If there are no active queries for 5 minutes, the activity monitor gracefully places the compute node into the Idle state to save energy and resources.

When you connect to an idle compute (in your case, using Prisma), Neon automatically activates it. Activation typically happens within a few seconds.

When the connection timeout error is thrown, it most likely means that the Prisma query engine timed out before the Neon compute node is active  or it could be a combination of compute startup time and latency. This error also occurs if you attempt to connect to Neon project that has been deleted or is inaccessible for some other reason.

The solution is to increase the [connection pool timeout](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/performance-and-optimization/connection-management#increasing-the-pool-timeout) setting. You can do that by setting theÂ `pool_timeout` parameter to 0 or to a value larger than the default (10 seconds). This parameter is set by appending `&pool_timeout=20` to the end of the Neon connection string that you defined in your Prisma database connection configuration. You can also try setting the connect_timeout variable.

You can set mutliple Prisma connection variables on your connection string. For example:

```bash
postgres://<user>:<password>@<endpoint_hostname>:5432/neondb?pgbouncer=true&pool_timeout=0&connect_timeout=30
```
