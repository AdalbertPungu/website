Vercel recently introduced the [Vercel Storage](https://vercel.com/docs/storage) suite, which is a collection of managed storage products that you can integrate with your frontend framework. Included in the suite of storage products is [Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres), which is serverless Postgres powered by Neon.

With Vercel Postgres, creating, deleting, and managing a Neon Postgres instance happens in the Vercel dashboard rather than the Neon Console or using the Neon API. In fact, you do not need a Neon account to use Vercel Postgres. Everything is managed from the Vercel platform.
