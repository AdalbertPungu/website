Grafbase allows you to combine your data sources into a centralized GraphQL endpoint, which you can deploy at the edge using the [Grafbase Edge Gateway](https://website-git-gb-3006-add-changelog-for-resolvers.grafbase-vercel.dev/docs/edge-gateway).

This guide describes how to create a new GraphQL API using Grafbase and use Grafbase [resolvers](https://website-git-gb-3006-add-changelog-for-resolvers.grafbase-vercel.dev/docs/edge-gateway/resolvers) to interact with your Neon database at the edge.
