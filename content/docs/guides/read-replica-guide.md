Neon includes read replicas as part of its offering for Pro plan users. This guide will lead you through the process of creating a read replica in Neon that can be used for your read-only workloads. The general methodology of using read replicas to segregate read-only work from your production database operations can be applied to a variety of uses cases such as offloading analytics work, distributing read requests to one or more read replicas to achieve higher throughput, providing read-only data access to specific users or applications who do not require write access, or configuring right-sized compute resources for different users and applications.
