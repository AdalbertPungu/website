[PolyScale](https://docs.polyscale.ai/) is a serverless database cache service. With Neon's PolyScale integration, you can easily distribute and cache your data globally, allowing you to scale your database without altering transactional semantics. No coding or infrastructure changes are required. You can connect Neon to PolyScale in seconds, providing your database-backed applications with speedy access to your Neon data from anywhere in the world.

The Neon PolyScale integration creates a PolyScale cache for your Neon project's primary read-write compute endpoint and provides you with a PolyScale connection string. In order to use the cache you must connect to your database via the PolyScale connection string.   

## Prerequisites

- A PolyScale account
- A Neon account and a Neon project

## Add the PolyScale integration

1. In the Neon Console, navigate to the **Integrations** page.
2. Sign in to PolyScale using your Google, GitHub, or email account.
