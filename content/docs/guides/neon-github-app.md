2. Generates a new Neon API key for your Neon account.
3. Creates a global secret in the GitHub repository containing the Neon API key.

1. In the Neon Console, navigate to the **Integrations** page for your project.
2. Locate the GitHub integration and click **Manage** to open the **GitHub integration** drawer.
3. Select a GitHub repository to connect to and click **Save**.
