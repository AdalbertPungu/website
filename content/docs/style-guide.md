## The Neon voice

The voice used in Neon's documentation aims to be clear, direct, and precise. The objective is to provide information that is easy to search and scan.

The language used in documentation should be approachable, yet succinct and to the point.

## Topic types

It is a common practice in the software industry to categorize documentation into different types, such as:

- Concepts
- Tasks
- Reference
- Troubleshooting

Where possible, Neon utilizes topic types in our documentation, as they offer several advantages:

- Improved Content Navigation: With a vast amount of information available in our documentation, topic types provide consistent structures that make our content easier to navigate and locate.
- Enhanced Readability: The consistent structures of topic types make our content easier to digest and understand, improving the overall readability of our documentation.
- Reader-Centered Focus: Our documentation is created by contributors, who may sometimes write from their own perspective. However, topic types (especially tasks) help present information in a manner that is more focused on assisting readers in achieving their goals, rather than solely documenting the implementation of a feature.

By incorporating topic types, Neon can improve the effectiveness and user-friendliness of our documentation, ensuring that readers can quickly locate and understand the information they need.

## Link instead of repeating text

In our documentation, we strive to avoid repeating information from other topics. Instead, we link to the original source of information and explain why it is important.

By doing so, we can:

- Ensure Consistency: When information is repeated in multiple locations, it can easily become outdated or conflicting. Linking to a single source of truth ensures that our documentation is consistent and up-to-date.

- Save Time: Repeating information in multiple locations takes time and effort to maintain. Linking to a single source of truth reduces the need for duplicating work and saves time.

- Reduce Confusion: Linking to a single source of truth helps readers to understand the context of the information they are reading and avoid confusion that may arise from contradictory information.

In summary, linking to a single source of truth helps to ensure consistency, save time, and reduce confusion, making our documentation more effective and user-friendly.
