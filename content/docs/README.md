# Docs

Welcome to Neon docs! This folder contains the source code of the [Neon docs](https://neon.tech/docs/).

## Basic information

1. Every single Markdown file in this folder will be turned into a docs page.
2. Folder and file names should follow kebab-case.
3. `slug` is generated based on the folder structure and file names inside this folder.

   In order to see page `slug`, you can [start the project](../../README.md#run-the-website), [open GraphQL Playground](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/using-graphql-playground/#accessing-the-playground) and [run query](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/querying-data/running-queries-with-graphiql/#example-of-using-graphiql) that will display all docs pages with fields `title` and `slug`:

   ```graphql
   {
     allMdx(filter: { fileAbsolutePath: { regex: "/content/docs/" } }) {
       nodes {
         frontmatter {
           title
         }
         slug
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   </details>

4. Page `path` is generated by combining [`DOCS_BASE_PATH`](../../src/constants/docs.js) and page `slug`.
5. There is no need to add `h1` to the page since it will be displayed automatically with the value from `title` field.

## Fields

Right now Markdown files accept 2 fields:

1. `title` — title of the page (required)
2. `redirectFrom` — array of strings with paths to redirect from to the page, should start and end with a slash, e.g. `/docs/old-path/`
3. `isDraft` — flag that says the page is not ready yet. It won't appear in production but will appear in the development mode.
4. `enableTableOfContents` — flag that turns on the display of the outline for the page. The outline gets built out of second and third-level headings ([`h2`, `h3`]), thus appears as two-level nested max.

> ⚠️ Please note that the project won't build if at least one of the Markdown files is missing a required field.

## Sidebar

Sidebar data is stored in the [sidebar.yaml](./sidebar.yaml) file.

### How to add a new category

In order to add a new category to the sidebar, add a new item to the top level array with keys `title` and `items`.

For example:

```diff
 - title: Category 1
   items:
     - title: Page 1
       slug: page-1
+- title: Category 2
+  items:
+    - title: Page 2
+      slug: page-2
```

### How to add a new subcategory

In order to add a new subcategory, add a new item to `items` array with keys `title` and `items` under specific category.

For example:

```diff
 - title: Category 1
   items:
     - title: Page 1
       slug: page-1
 - title: Category 2
   items:
     - title: Page 2
       slug: page-2
+    - title: Subcategory 1
+      items:
+        - title: Page 3
+          slug: page-3
```

### How to add a new page

In order to add a new page, add a new item to `items` array with keys `title` and `slug` under specific category or subcategory:

- `title` in the sidebar may differ from `title` in Markdown file.
- `slug` should always match page's slug.

For example:

```diff yaml
 - title: Category 1
   items:
     - title: Page 1
       slug: page-1
 - title: Category 2
   items:
     - title: Page 2
       slug: page-2
    - title: Subcategory 1
      items:
        - title: Page 3
          slug: page-3
+       - title: Page 4
+         slug: page-4
+   - title: Page 5
+     slug: page-5
```

### How to add a single page to doc sidebar

To add a single page <https://example.com/changelog> to the docs sidebar, add the boolean `isStandalone` to the first level of the list

- `title` in the sidebar may differ from `title` in Markdown file.
- `slug` should always match page's slug.
- `isStandalone` - the boolean for the single page in sidebar.

```diff yaml
+- title: Changelog
+  slug: changelog
+  isStandalone: true
 - title: Category 1
   items:
     - title: Page 1
       slug: page-1
 - title: Category 2
   items:
     - title: Page 2
       slug: page-2
    - title: Subcategory 1
      items:
        - title: Page 3
          slug: page-3
```

## Code blocks

All available languages for code blocks can be found [here](https://prismjs.com/index.html#supported-languages).

## Images

The images should be sourced in `docs` directory and be used in `.md` with the relative path

For example:

````md
├── content
│ ├── docs
│ ├── conceptual-guides
│ ├── images
│ ├── neon_architecture_2.png // put images in the same directory as your .md file
│ ├── architecture-overview.md

And use the relative path in your content.

```md
architecture-overview.md

![Neon architecture diagram](./images/neon_architecture_2.png)
```
````

With this approach, all images on your doc pages will be displayed both on the production and GitHub preview.

## Definition list

Custom `mdx` component that makes possible using [extended markdown syntax for descriptions lists](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#definition-lists). Fully [WCAG-compliant](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H40.html). It provides an accessible way to make term lists, and it's a generally good way to add structure to a text when a writer needs more than bullets and less than headings.

The usage is pretty [straightforward](https://github.com/neondatabase/website/pull/231/commits/8f795eaf700c31794a2267fc5978c22bfc649a0c):

```md
/_ other content here _/}

<DefinitionList>
{/* required new line */}
Scenario executor
: First definition
: Second definition

Soak test
: First and only definition

Smoke test
Another term for smoke test
: First definition for both terms
: Second definition for both terms
: ...n definition for both terms

[Stress test](/)
: First and **only** definition for both terms with additional markup <br/> Read more: [link](/)

{/_ required new line _/}
</DefinitionList>

{/_ other content here _/}
```

### Acceptable markup for term

- `*italic*`
- `[link](/)`
- `**strong**` - but that doesn't make sense, by default terms appearance is already bold
- `inlineCode` - but it doesn't alter it's change in this context

### Constraints

- using emojis in `dt` is prohibited, as it potentially can mess up with `id` attribute, and `href` at anchor. We can not be sure which range will be used to display a particular symbol (depends on editor OS) and if it is going to be stripped.
- if there are multiple terms for a given set of descriptions, only the first one will have an `id` and an `anchor`
- make absolutely sure your `dt` text content is unique across the page to avoid `id` collisions

### Acceptable markup for description

- everything for term
- emojis
- any inline html
- line breaks `<br/>` (recommended way to separate visually something inside a single description)

## Contributing

For small changes and spelling fixes, we recommend using the GitHub UI because Markdown files are relatively easy to edit.

For larger contributions, consider [running the project locally](../../README.md#getting-started) to see how changes look like before making a pull request.
