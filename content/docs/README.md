# Docs

Welcome to Neon docs! This folder contains the source code of the [Neon docs](https://neon.tech/docs/).

## Basic information

1. Every single Markdown file in this folder will be turned into a docs page.
2. Folder and file names should follow kebab-case.
3. `slug` is generated based on the folder structure and file names inside this folder.

   In order to see page `slug`, you can [start the project](../../README.md#run-the-website), [open GraphQL Playground](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/using-graphql-playground/#accessing-the-playground) and [run query](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/querying-data/running-queries-with-graphiql/#example-of-using-graphiql) that will display all docs pages with fields `title` and `slug`:

   ```graphql
   {
     allMdx(filter: { fileAbsolutePath: { regex: "/content/docs/" } }) {
       nodes {
         frontmatter {
           title
         }
         slug
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   </details>

4. Page `path` is generated by combining [`DOCS_BASE_PATH`](../../src/constants/docs.js) and page `slug`.
5. There is no need to add `h1` to the page since it will be displayed automatically with the value from `title` field.

## Fields

Right now Markdown files accept 2 fields:

1. `title` — title of the page (required)
2. `isDraft` — flag that says the page is not ready yet. It won't appear in production but will appear in the development mode.

> ⚠️ Please note that project won't build if one of Markdown files doesn't have even a single required field!

## Sidebar

Sidebar data is stored in the [sidebar.yaml](./sidebar.yaml) file.

### How to add a new category

In order to add a new category to the sidebar, add a new item to the top level array with keys `title` and `items`.

For example:

```diff
 - title: Category 1
   items:
     - title: Page 1
       slug: page-1
+- title: Category 2
+  items:
+    - title: Page 2
+      slug: page-2
```

### How to add a new subcategory

In order to add a new subcategory, add a new item to `items` array with keys `title` and `items` under specific category.

For example:

```diff
 - title: Category 1
   items:
     - title: Page 1
       slug: page-1
 - title: Category 2
   items:
     - title: Page 2
       slug: page-2
+    - title: Subcategory 1
+      items:
+        - title: Page 3
+          slug: page-3
```

### How to add a new page

In order to add a new page, add a new item to `items` array with keys `title` and `slug` under specific category or subcategory:

- `title` in the sidebar may differ from `title` in Markdown file.
- `slug` should always match page's slug.

For example:

```diff yaml
 - title: Category 1
   items:
     - title: Page 1
       slug: page-1
 - title: Category 2
   items:
     - title: Page 2
       slug: page-2
    - title: Subcategory 1
      items:
        - title: Page 3
          slug: page-3
+       - title: Page 4
+         slug: page-4
+   - title: Page 5
+     slug: page-5
```

## Contributing

For small changes and spelling fixes, we recommend using the GitHub UI because Markdown files are relatively easy to edit.

For larger contributions, consider [running the project locally](../../README.md#getting-started) to see how changes look like before making a pull request.
