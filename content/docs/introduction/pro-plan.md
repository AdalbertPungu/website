The Neon **Pro** plan is a usage-based plan intended for small to medium teams or projects that require more compute and storage than are available with the [Neon Free Tier](../introduction/technical-preview-free-tier). Because the Pro plan is usage-based, you only pay for what you use and you never have to worry about over-provisioning. If you find that the Pro plan is more than you require, you can easily revert back to the Free Tier in just a few clicks. No calls, conversations, or waiting required. Our intention is to make upgrading to Pro risk-free and hassle-free for users who want to try it. The Pro plan has no fixed contract or obligations.

The Pro plan bills for usage on a monthly basis. For information about our billing metrics and prices, please refer to our [Billing](../introduction/billing) page. For a calculator you can use to estimate monthly costs, see the [Pricing](https://neon.tech/pricing) page on our website. If you still have questions or need help estimating monthly costs, please do not hesitate to reach out to our [Sales](https://neon.tech/contact-sales) team. We're ready to help.
