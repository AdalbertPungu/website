Our developers are focused on making Neon the default choice for serverless PostgreSQL. This roadmap describes committed features that are coming soon. We are as excited as you are to see new features in Neon, but their development, release, and timing are at our discretion.

As always, we are listening. If you see something you like, something you disagree with, or something you'd love for us to add, let us know in our Discord feedback channel.

## Coming soon

Here's a snapshot of what we're working on now:

* [Observability](#observability)
* [Developer workflows](#developer-workflows)
* [Account management](#account-management)
* [More regions](#more-regions)

### Observability

* **Autoscaling visualizations**

    Adding dynamic charts, populated with real-time data, to help you visualize how autoscaling impacts CPU and RAM usage over time.

### Developer workflows

* **Branch restore with Time Travel Assist**

    Instantly restore a branch to an earlier state in its history. Use Time Travel Assist to run queries against historical data, making sure you are restoring to the right point in time.

    We'll be adding the ability to restore to another branch as well soon after.

    If there are any new branching features that you think could help your development team's workflow, let us know in [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1176467419317940276/1176788564890112042).

* **Improvements to Vercel integration**

    To ensure that users of the integration that access Neon from Vercel's serverless environment do not run out of connections, we're changing the database connection settings added to a Vercel project to pooled connections by default.

### Account management

* **Organization support**

    We are adding features to support using Neon in your organization. Later, we'll add support for managing individual teams within the organization as well.

### More regions

* **Australia**

    Adding regional support for Australia.

## A brief history of Neon

The Neon **Limited Preview** started in February 2022 and was made available to a small number of select users and friends.

On June 15th, 2022, the Neon team announced the [Technical Preview](#technical-preview), making Neon available to a wider audience. Thousands of users were able to try Neon's [Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier).

On December 6th, 2022, Neon released its branching feature and dropped the invite gate, welcoming everyone to try Neon's Free Tier.

In the spring of 2023, Neon launched [paid plans](https://neon.tech/pricing) with new features like Project Sharing, [Autoscaling](/docs/introduction/autoscaling), and [Autosuspend](/docs/introduction/auto-suspend). We also added support for US East (N. Virginia)

In the summer of 2023, we released the [Neon CLI](/docs/reference/neon-cli). New features included a configurable [history retention](/docs/introduction/point-in-time-restore) window as well as support for Postgres 16 and the Isreal (Tel Aviv) region. We also announced [SOC 2 Type 1](https://neon.tech/blog/soc2-type-1#our-journey-to-soc2) compliance.

In the fall of 2023, we added [IP allowlisting](/docs/introduction/ip-allow), email signup, and [logical replication](docs/introduction/logical-replication). We also announced [SOC 2 Type 2](https://neon.tech/blog/soc2-type2) compliance.

## Technical Preview

Neon sets a high standard for what constitutes a feature-complete product, meaning that all intended core functionality is implemented and operates as expected. While many features may be operational today, there may still be some that are under development or refinement. Neon will remain in Technical Preview while the remaining features are still being developed and perfected.
