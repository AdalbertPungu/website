Our developers work hard to make Neon the default choice for serverless PostgreSQL in the cloud. While we have a lot of great stuff in the pipeline, this roadmap is focused on features and improvements that are fully in flight: things our development teams are finalizing right now, which you can expect to see very soon, as well as the comitted tasks our teams will take up next. 

As always, we welcome all feedback. If you see something in Neon's implementation of Postgres that you disagree with, that can be improved, or anything missing that you feel should be there, [let us know](link to best place for that).

## Latest features

For the latest features and fixes, check our [Changelog](docs/changelog), updated every Friday. You can subscribe to Changelog updates using our [RSS feed](https://neon.tech/docs/changelog/rss.xml).

## Coming soon

Here's a snapshot of what we're working on now:

* **Branch restore with Time Travel Assist.**

  Instantly restore a branch to an earlier state in its history. Use Time Travel Assist to run queries against historical data, making sure you are restoring to the right point in time.

* **Autoscaling visualizations.**

  Adding dynamic charts, populated with real-time data, to help you visualize how autoscaling impacts your CPU and RAM usage over time. The first of many features to improve observability.

* **Better onboarding**

  Ongoing improvements to the onboarding experience are in the works. You can expect incremental updates in the upcoming weeks.



## What's up next

And here's a glimpse at the features we'll be taking on next:

* **More regions**

  Support for more regions will be released in the coming months.
* **Improvements to Vercel integration**

  Adding support for GitHub and Bitbucket as part of the Vercel integration.

## A brief history of time

The Neon **Limited Preview** started in February, 2022, and was made available to a small number of select users and friends.

On June 15th, 2022, the Neon team announced the [Technical Preview](#technical-preview), making Neon available to a wider audience. Thousands of users were able to try Neon's [Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier).

On December 6th, 2022, Neon released its branching feature and dropped the invite gate, welcoming everyone to try Neon's Free Tier.

On March 15th, 2023, Neon launched paid plans, providing increased limits and added features, including _Project sharing_ and _Autoscaling_. For information about Neon's paid  plans, refer to our [Pricing](https://neon.tech/pricing) page.


## Technical Preview

Neon sets a high standard for what constitutes a feature-complete product, meaning that all intended core functionality is implemented and operates as expected. While many features may be operational today, there may still be some that are under development or refinement. Neon will remain in Technical Preview while the remaining features are still being developed and perfected.
