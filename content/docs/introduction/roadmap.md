The Neon **Limited Preview** started in February, 2022, and was made available to a small number of select users and friends.

On June 15th, 2022, the Neon team announced the **Technical Preview**, making Neon available to a wider audience. Thousands of users were able to try Neon's [Free Tier](../introduction/technical-preview-free-tier).

On December 6th, 2022, Neon released its branching feature and dropped the invite gate, welcoming everyone to try Neon's Free Tier.

On March 15th, 2023, Neon launched paid plans, providing increased limits and added features, including _Project sharing_ and _Autoscaling_. For information about Neon's paid  plans, refer to our [Pricing](https://neon.tech/pricing) page.

Support for more regions and additional features will be released in the coming months.
