## Support types

### Community Support

Community support includes the [Neon Discord Server](/discord) or the [Neon Discourse Community](https://community.neon.tech/), where you can ask questions or see what others are doing with Neon. You will find Neon users and members of the Neon team actively engaged in both communities. 

### Neon Customer Support

Neon Customer Support provides access to the Neon Support team. 

You can open support tickets in the Neon Console. Look for the **Support** link in the sidebar. It opens the **Create Support Ticket** modal, where you can describe your issue. To access the modal directly, [click here](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=support).

You can expect an initial response time of 2 business days, from 6am to 6pm Pacific Standard Time (UTC -8), Monday through Friday, excluding public holidays in the United States. For custom support solutions, please contact [Sales](https://neon.tech/contact-sales).

#### Support email

If you're unable to access Neon's primary support channels (e.g., the support ticket form in the Neon Console or our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/92vNTzKDGp)), you can use the following email as a fallback:

**Email**: `support@neon.tech`

Response times might be longer than our primary channels, so we appreciate your patience.

### Prioritized Neon Customer Support

With Prioritized Neon Customer Support, your support tickets are given priority by the Neon Support team. 

### Enterprise Support with SLAs

With Enterprise Support, your support tickets are given priority by the Neon Support team and handled according to SLAs outlined in your Master Service Agreement.
