## Open a support ticket

[Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) and [Custom Plan](/docs/introduction/custom-plan) users can open a support ticket from the Neon console. Look for the **Support** link in the sidebar. It opens the **Create Support Ticket** modal, where you can describe your issue.
