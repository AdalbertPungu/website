## Community Support

Community support includes the [Neon Discord Server](/discord) or the [Neon Discourse Community](https://community.neon.tech/), where you can ask questions or see what others are doing with Neon. You will find Neon users and members of the Neon team actively engaged in both communities. 

## Neon Customer Support

Neon Customer Support provides access to the Neon Support team. 

You can open support tickets in the Neon Console. Look for the **Support** link in the sidebar. It opens the **Create Support Ticket** modal, where you can describe your issue. To access the modal directly, [click here](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=support).
