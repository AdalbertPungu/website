## Community support

Community support includes the [Neon Discord Server](/discord) or the [Neon Discourse Community](https://community.neon.tech/), where you can ask questions or see what others are doing with Neon. You will find Neon users and members of the Neon team actively engaged in both communities. 

## Expert support

Expert support includes access to the Neon Support team via support tickets. 

You can open support tickets in the Neon Console. Look for the **Support** link in the sidebar. It opens the **Create Support Ticket** modal, where you can describe your issue. To access the modal directly, [click here](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=support).

You can expect an initial response time of 2 business days, from 6am to 6pm Pacific Standard Time (UTC -8), Monday through Friday, excluding public holidays in the United States. For custom support solutions, please contact [Sales](https://neon.tech/contact-sales).

## Priority support

With priority support, your support tickets are given priority by the Neon Support team and you can request a video chat. Requests for video chat should be submitted via a support ticket.

## Enterprise support

With Enterprise Support, you have everything offered with the Priority plan plus retail customer support, dedicated Customer Success Team support, and SLAs.
