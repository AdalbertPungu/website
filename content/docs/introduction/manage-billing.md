## Purchase Neon on AWS Marketplace

As an alternative to Neon billing, you can purchase Neon on the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-o32z34khv4272?sr=0-1&applicationId=AWSMPContessa&utm_campaign=Developer%20Days&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8U-1v7Sm5HHexFnV3Mkkwwsq5hnq9ThQnbQOqhuB11RT9cNwtAoalhaq98WMgL70rwfFhq) or through the [AWS Private Offers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/private-offers-overview.html) program.

Purchasing Neon from the AWS Marketplace gives you consolidated billing, seamless provisioning, and the ability to use AWS credits on Neon.

If you have any questions about this billing option, please reach out to our [Sales](https://neon.tech/contact-sales) team.
