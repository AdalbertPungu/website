Changing your plan to one with lower usage allowances may affect the performance of your applications. To compare plan allowances, see [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans#neon-plans).

If you are downgrading your plan, you will be required to remove any projects, branches, or data that exceed your new plan allowances.

<Admonition type="note">
Downgrading directly from [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans#scale) to [Launch](/docs/introduction/plans#launch) is currently not supported. You must downgrade to the Free Tier first, and then upgrade to Launch. This limitation will be removed in a future release.
</Admonition>

To downgrade from an [Enterprise](/docs/introduction/plans#enterprise) plan, please contact [Sales](https://neon.tech/contact-sales). Cancellation of an Enterprise plan is handled according to the Master Subscription Agreement (MSA) outlined in the customer agreement.
