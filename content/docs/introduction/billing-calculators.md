### Pro Plan Cost Estimator

The **Billing** page in the Neon Console provides a **Pro Plan Cost Estimator** tool, which estimates costs based on your current project usage. If you have ever wondered, "How much would my monthly cost be if I upgraded to the Neon Pro Plan?", this tool provides the answer. To access it, navigate to the **Billing** page via the sidebar of the Neon Console, and select **Open Cost Estimator**.

To provide cost estimates, the **Pro Plan Cost Estimator** requires at least one month of project usage.
