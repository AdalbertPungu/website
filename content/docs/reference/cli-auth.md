## Before you begin

Ensure that you have [installed the Neon CLI](/docs/reference/neon-cli#install-the-neon-cli).

## The `auth` command

Authenticates the user or caller to Neon.

### Usage

```bash
neonctl auth
```

The command launches a browser window where you can authorize the Neon CLI to access your Neon account. After granting permission, your credentials are saved locally to a configuration file named `credentials.json`.

```text
/home/<home>/.config/neonctl/credentials.json
```

### Options

Only [global options](/docs/reference/neon-cli/global-options) apply.
