## Get started

Make sure that you [install the Neon CLI](../neon-cli/get-started) first. Once you have done that, you can manage your Neon projects from the command line.

## The `auth` command

Authenticates the user or caller to Neon.

### Usage

```bash
neonctl auth
```

The command launches a browser window where you can authorize the Neon CLI to access your Neon account. After granting permission, your credentials are saved locally to a configuration file named `credentials.json`.

```text
/home/<home>/.config/neonctl/credentials.json
```

### Commands

None.

### Options

Only [global options](../neon-cli/global-options) apply.
