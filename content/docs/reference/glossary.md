<a id="api">API</a> 

See [Neon API](/docs/reference/glossary/#neon-api).

<a id="api-key">API Key</a>

A unique identifier used to authenticate a user or calling program to an API. An API key is required to authenticate to the Neon API. For more information, see [Using API keys](/docs/get-started-with-neon/using-api-keys/).

## B

<a id="branches-coming-soon/"></a>

<a id="branch">Branch</a>

A copy of Project data created from a current or past state. A branch can be independently modified from its originating Project data. See [Branching](/docs/conceptual-guides/branching/).

## C

<a id="ci-cd">CI/CD</a>

Continuous integration and continuous delivery or continuous deployment.

<a id="control-plane">Control Plane</a>

A part of the Neon architecture that manages cloud storage and compute resources.

<a id="compute">Compute</a>

A service that provides virtualized computing resources (CPU, memory, and storage) for running applications. A Neon Compute runs PostgreSQL. Each Neon Project contains a Compute. The amount of Compute resources available to a Neon Project is currently subject to the limits defined by the Technical Preview Free Tier. A Neon Compute is stateless and is automatically activated or suspended based on user activity.

<a id="connection-pstring">Connection String</a>

A string containing details for connecting to a Neon Project. The details include a user name, Project ID, host address, port number, and database name; for example:

```terminal
postgres://user1@black-sky-342827.cloud.neon.tech:5432/main`.
```

The connection string for a Neon Project is provided on the **Dashboard** tab in the Neon Console, under **Connection Details**. The connection string displayed that is displayed immediately after creating a Project also includes the userâ€™s password, temporarily. For security, the password is removed from the connection string after navigating away from the Dashboard.

<a id="console">Console</a>

See [Neon Console](/docs/reference/glossary/#neon-console).
