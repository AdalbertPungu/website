## Before you begin

- Before running the `set-context` command, ensure that you have [installed the Neon CLI](/docs/reference/neon-cli#install-the-neon-cli).
- If you have not authenticated with the [neonctl auth](/docs/reference/cli-auth) command, running a Neon CLI command automatically launches the Neon CLI browser authentication process. Alternatively, you can specify a Neon API key using the `--api-key` option when running a command. See [Connect](/docs/reference/neon-cli#connect).

## The `set-context` command

This command sets a background context for the duration of your CLI session, letting you perform project or branch specific actions without having to specify the project or branch id in every command.

### Usage

```bash
neonctl set-context <option>
```

### Options

The `set-context` command requires you set at least one of these options:
| Option       | Description   | Type   | Required  |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------ | :------: |
| `--project-id` | Project ID    | string | Sets the identified project as the context for the rest of your CLI session, or until reset |
| `--branch-id` | Branch ID | string | Sets the identified branch as the context for the rest of your CLI session, or until reset |

[Global options](/docs/reference/neon-cli#global-options) are also supported.
