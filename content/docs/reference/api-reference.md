The Neon API allows you to manage projects programmatically, which is helpful when using Neon as a part of a CI/CD pipeline.

Refer to the the [Neon API V1 reference](https://neon.tech/api-reference) for supported methods.

The next version of the Neon API is currently in preview. To try this version of the Neon API, refer to the [Neon API V2 reference](https://neon.tech/api-reference). This version of the Neon API is only partially implemented and only intended for review purposes. If you encounter issues using the Neon API V2 preview, please contact [Neon Support](mailto:support@neon.tech).  

Accessing the Neon API requires an API key. To obtain an API key, refer to the instructions in [Using API keys](/docs/get-started-with-neon/using-api-keys/).
