The Neon API allows you to manage projects programmatically, which is helpful when using Neon as a part of a CI/CD pipeline.

Refer to the the [API reference](https://neon.tech/api-reference) for available methods. Accessing the Neon API requires an API key. To obtain an API key, refer to the instructions in [Using API keys](/docs/get-started-with-neon/using-api-keys/).
