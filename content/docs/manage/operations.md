An operation is an action performed by Neon Control Plane on a Neon resource. Operations are typically initiated by user actions, such as creating a branch or deleting a database. Some Operations may be initiated by the Neon Control Plane, such as suspending a compute instance after a period of inactivity or checking the availability of a compute instance. You can monitor operations to keep an eye on the overall health of your Neon project or to check the status or the duration of specific operations.

Operations include:

- `apply_config`: Applies a new configuration to a Neon object or resource. For example, creating or updating a user or database triggers this operation.
- `check_availability`: Checks the availability of an endpoint compute resource. This operation is a periodic load generated by the Control Plane to determine if a endpoint compute resource can start and read and write data.
- `create_compute`: Creates a Neon compute resource
- `create_timeline`: Creates a branch, which occurs when creating child branch or when creating a new project, which creates a `main` branch.
- `delete_tenant`: Deletes the storage data when a project is deleted.
- `delete_timeline`: Deletes a branch.
- `tenant_detach`: Detaches the storage data when migrating a Neon project to another Neon Pageserver node.
- `tenant_migrate`: Attaches the storage data when migrating a Neon project to another Neon Pageserver node.
- `replace_safekeeper`: Replaces the [Safekeeper](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/glossary/#safekeeper).
- `start_compute`: Starts an endpoint compute resource
- `stop_compute`: Stops an endpoint compute resource
- `suspend_compute`: Suspends an endpoint compute resource

## View operations

The **Operations** widget on the Neon **Dashboard** displays operations. You can also view operations in **Settings** > **Operations**.

Operation details include:

- **Action/ID**: The action performed by the operation.
- **Branch**: The branch on which the operation was performed.
- **Status**: The status of the operation.
- **Duration**: The duration of the operation.
- **Date**: The date and time the operation occurred.

## View operations with the Neon API

You can also view operations using the Neon API, which provides operations data in an unmodified format. For example:

```json
{
  "operation": {
    "id": "97c7a650-e4ff-43d7-8c58-4c67f5050167",
    "project_id": "autumn-disk-484331",
    "branch_id": "br-wispy-dew-591433",
    "endpoint_id": "ep-orange-art-714542",
    "action": "check_availability",
    "status": "finished",
    "failures_count": 0,
    "created_at": "2022-12-09T08:47:52Z",
    "updated_at": "2022-12-09T08:47:56Z"
  }
}
```
