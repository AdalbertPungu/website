An operation is an action performed by the Neon Control Plane on a Neon object or resource. Operations are typically initiated by user actions, such as creating a branch or deleting a database. Other operations may be initiated by the Neon Control Plane, such as suspending a [compute endpoint](/docs/reference/glossary#compute-endpoint) after a period of inactivity or checking its availability. You can monitor operations to keep an eye on the overall health of your Neon project or to check the status of specific operations. When working with the Neon API, you can also poll operations to ensure that an API request is completed before issuing another API request. For more information, see [Poll operation status](#poll-operation-status).

Operations include:

- `apply_config`: Applies a new configuration to a Neon object or resource. For example, creating, deleting, or updating  PostgreSQL users and databases initiates this operation.
- `check_availability`: Checks the availability of a [compute endpoint](/docs/reference/glossary#compute-endpoint). This operation, performed by the [availability checker](/docs/reference/glossary#availability-checker), is a periodic load generated by the Control Plane that makes sure a compute endpoint is able to start and read and write data.
- `create_compute`: Creates a compute endpoint. Creating a compute endpoint, a branch with a compute endpoint, or a Neon project initiates this operation. A Neon project is created with a read-write endpoint by default. For related information, see [Manage endpoints](/docs/manage/endpoints).
- `create_branch`: Creates a [branch](/docs/reference/glossary#branch) in a Neon project. For related information, see [Manage branches](/docs/manage/branches).
- `create_timeline`: Creates a [project](/docs/reference/glossary#project) with its primary branch.
- `delete_tenant`: Deletes the stored data when a Neon project is deleted.
- `delete_timeline`: Deletes a branch.
- `start_compute`: Starts a compute endpoint when there is an event or action that requires compute resources. For example, connecting to a suspended compute endpoint initiates this operation.
- `suspend_compute`: Suspends a compute endpoint after a period of inactivity. For information about how Neon manages compute resources, see [Compute lifecycle](/docs/introduction/compute-lifecycle/).

## View operations

You can view operation in **Operations** widget on the Neon **Dashboard** or on the **Operations** page.

![Operations](/docs/manage/operations.png)

Operation details include:

- **Action/ID**: The action performed by the operation.
- **Branch**: The branch on which the operation was performed.
- **Status**: The status of the operation.
- **Duration**: The duration of the operation.
- **Date**: The date and time the operation occurred.

## View operations with the Neon API

You can use the [Neon API](https://neon.tech/api-reference/v2/) to view operations. The following methods are provided:

### List operations

Lists operations for the specified project. This method supports response pagination. For more information, see [List operations with pagination](#list-operations-with-pagination).

```text
/projects/{project_id}/operations
```

cURL command:

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/autumn-disk-484331/operations' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY'
```

Response:

```json

      "branch_id": "br-wispy-dew-591433",
      "endpoint_id": "ep-orange-art-714542",
      "action": "check_availability",
      "status": "finished",
      "failures_count": 0,
      "created_at": "2022-12-09T08:47:52Z",
      "updated_at": "2022-12-09T08:47:56Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "0f3daf10-2544-425c-86d3-9a9932ab25b9",
      "project_id": "autumn-disk-484331",

    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "cursor": "2022-12-07T00:45:05.262011Z"
  }
}

```

### List operations with pagination

Pagination allows you to limit the number of operations displayed, as the number of operations for project can be large. To paginate responses, issue an initial request with a `limit` value. For brevity, the limit is set to 1 in the following example.

cURL command:

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/autumn-disk-484331/operations?limit=1' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "operations": [
    {
      "id": "97c7a650-e4ff-43d7-8c58-4c67f5050167",
      "project_id": "autumn-disk-484331",
      "branch_id": "br-wispy-dew-591433",
      "endpoint_id": "ep-orange-art-714542",
      "action": "check_availability",
      "status": "finished",
      "failures_count": 0,
      "created_at": "2022-12-09T08:47:52Z",
      "updated_at": "2022-12-09T08:47:56Z"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "cursor": "2022-12-09T08:47:52.20417Z"
  }
}
```

To list the next page of operations, add the `cursor` value returned in the response body of the initial or previous request and a `limit` value for the next page.

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/autumn-disk-484331/operations?cursor=2022-12-09T08%3A47%3A52.20417Z&limit=1' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "operations": [
    {
      "id": "0f3daf10-2544-425c-86d3-9a9932ab25b9",
      "project_id": "autumn-disk-484331",
      "branch_id": "br-wispy-dew-591433",
      "endpoint_id": "ep-orange-art-714542",
      "action": "check_availability",
      "status": "finished",
      "failures_count": 0,
      "created_at": "2022-12-09T04:47:39Z",
      "updated_at": "2022-12-09T04:47:44Z"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "cursor": "2022-12-09T04:47:39.797163Z"
  }
}
```

### List operation

This method shows only the details for the specified operation ID.

```text
/projects/{project_id}/operations/{operation_id}
```

cURL command:

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/autumn-disk-484331/operations/97c7a650-e4ff-43d7-8c58-4c67f5050167' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "operation": {
    "id": "97c7a650-e4ff-43d7-8c58-4c67f5050167",
    "project_id": "autumn-disk-484331",
    "branch_id": "br-wispy-dew-591433",
    "endpoint_id": "ep-orange-art-714542",
    "action": "check_availability",
    "status": "finished",
    "failures_count": 0,
    "created_at": "2022-12-09T08:47:52Z",
    "updated_at": "2022-12-09T08:47:56Z"
  }
}
```

## Poll operation status

Some Neon API requests may take a few moments to complete. When using the Neon API programmatically, you can check the `status` of the operations before proceeding with the next request. For example, if you use API requests to create a branch and add a database to the branch, you may want to check the operation status of the create branch request before issuing the create database request.

The response to a Neon API request includes information about the operations that were initiated. For example, a create branch request initiates `create_branch` and `start_compute` operations.

```json
"operations": [
    {
      "id": "22acbb37-209b-4b90-a39c-8460090e1329",
      "project_id": "autumn-disk-484331",
      "branch_id": "br-dawn-scene-747675",
      "action": "create_branch",
      "status": "running",
      "failures_count": 0,
      "created_at": "2022-12-08T19:55:43Z",
      "updated_at": "2022-12-08T19:55:43Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "055b17e6-ffe3-47ab-b545-cfd7db6fd8b8",
      "project_id": "autumn-disk-484331",
      "branch_id": "br-dawn-scene-747675",
      "endpoint_id": "ep-small-bush-675287",
      "action": "start_compute",
      "status": "scheduling",
      "failures_count": 0,
      "created_at": "2022-12-08T19:55:43Z",
      "updated_at": "2022-12-08T19:55:43Z"
    }
  ]
  ```

You can use the [Get operation details](https://neon.tech/api-reference/v2#/Operation/getProjectOperation) method to poll the status of an operation using the operation ID. You might do so at intervals of a few seconds until the `status` of the operation changes to `finished` before you issue the next request. For example, this request polls the `start_compute` operation shown above:

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/autumn-disk-484331/operations/055b17e6-ffe3-47ab-b545-cfd7db6fd8b8' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "operation": {
      "id": "055b17e6-ffe3-47ab-b545-cfd7db6fd8b8",
      "project_id": "autumn-disk-484331",
      "branch_id": "br-dawn-scene-747675",
      "endpoint_id": "ep-small-bush-675287",
      "action": "start_compute",
      "status": "finished",
      "failures_count": 0,
      "created_at": "2022-12-08T19:55:43Z",
      "updated_at": "2022-12-08T19:55:43Z"
  }
}
```

Possible operation `status` values include `running`, `finished`, `failed`, `scheduling`.
