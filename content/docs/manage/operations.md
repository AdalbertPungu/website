An operation is an action performed by Neon Control Plane on a Neon resource. Operations are typically initiated by user actions, such as creating a branch or deleting a database. Some Operations may be initiated by the Neon Control Plane, such as suspending a compute instance after a period of inactivity or checking the availability of a compute instance. You can monitor operations to keep an eye on the overall health of your Neon project or to check the status or duration of specific operations.

Operations include:

- `apply_config`: Applies a new configuration to a Neon object or resource. For example, creating or updating a user or database triggers this operation.
- `check_availability`: Checks the availability of an endpoint compute resource. This operation is a periodic load generated by the Control Plane to check if an endpoint compute resource can start and read and write data.
- `create_compute`: Creates a Neon endpoint. Neon compute instances are referred to as [endpoints](../../reference/glossary/#endpoint).
- `create_timeline`: Creates a branch. This operation occurs when creating child branch or when creating a new project, which includes a `main` branch.
- `delete_tenant`: Deletes the storage data when a Neon project is deleted.
- `delete_timeline`: Deletes a branch. The terms _timeline_ and _branch_ are synonymous. The term _timeline_ is used internally in Neon.
- `start_compute`: Starts an [endpoint](../../reference/glossary/#endpoint) when there is an event or action that requires compute resources.
- `stop_compute`: Stops an [endpoint](../../reference/glossary/#endpoint). This operation occurs when a project is deleted.
- `suspend_compute`: Suspends an [endpoint](../../reference/glossary/#endpoint) when it is not being used.

## View operations

The **Operations** widget on the Neon **Dashboard** displays operations. You can also view operations in **Settings** > **Operations**.

Operation details include:

- **Action/ID**: The action performed by the operation.
- **Branch**: The branch on which the operation was performed.
- **Status**: The status of the operation.
- **Duration**: The duration of the operation.
- **Date**: The date and time the operation occurred.

## View operations with the Neon API

You can also view operations using the Neon API, which provides operations data in an unmodified format. For example:

```json
{
  "operation": {
    "id": "97c7a650-e4ff-43d7-8c58-4c67f5050167",
    "project_id": "autumn-disk-484331",
    "branch_id": "br-wispy-dew-591433",
    "endpoint_id": "ep-orange-art-714542",
    "action": "check_availability",
    "status": "finished",
    "failures_count": 0,
    "created_at": "2022-12-09T08:47:52Z",
    "updated_at": "2022-12-09T08:47:56Z"
  }
}
```
