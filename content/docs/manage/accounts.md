Neon offers two account types for you to choose from:

- **Personal account**
- **Organization account**

## Personal accounts

When you first sign up with Neon &#8212; either directly or by invite &#8212; you start with a personal account.

## Organization accounts

Any Neon user with a **paid personal account** can create an Organization account, which allows for sharing projects across the various members that make up your team. Whether you create an organization or are invited to join one, you still retain your personal account, letting you manage personal projects independently of any organizations you belong to.

From the Neon Console, you can navigate to your Organization dashboard, where you'll find all projects in the organization and various user management actions that you can take as the Admin.
