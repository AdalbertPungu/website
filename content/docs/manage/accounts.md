Neon offers two account types for you to choose from:

- **Personal account**
- **Organization account**

## Personal accounts

When you first sign up with Neon, whether you're signing up on your own or you're invited to join, you start with a personal account. During your [onboarding](/docs/get-started-with-neon#step-2---onboarding-in-the-neon-console)), you are prompted to create your first personal project that you can get started with.

You can always access your personal account settings from your **Profile** dropdown.

If you want to work with other people on this project, your options are:

- [Share] the project with another Neon user
- [Convert] the project from a personal to an Organization-level project, where you can then invite other users

## Organization accounts

Any Neon user with a **paid personal account** can create an Organization account, which allows for sharing projects across the various members that make up your team. Whether you create an organization or are invited to join one, you still retain your personal account, letting you manage personal projects independently of any organizations you belong to.

From the Neon Console, you can navigate to your Organization dashboard, where you'll find all projects in the organization and various user management actions that you can take as the Admin.

## Choosing the account for your project

For paid users, we encourage you to join the [Early Access program](https://neon.tech/early-access-program) and get started trying out Organization accounts. You can create a "personal" organization and transfer your current personal projects to that organization, as a way of experiencing these features. You can create another organization later, when you're ready to start working officially with your team.

Free Plan members cannot create an organization. You can keep your personal projects where they are. However, if you're invited to an Organization you're free to join as Member, Admin, or Guest.

## Project sharing vs organizations

If you are currently [sharing]() any of your projects, you may want to create an Organization and transfer your personal account projects there. As part of that conversion, you'll be able to invite people you've shared your project with to become part of your organization &#8212; as Members or as Admins. If you're on a Free Plan, you'll need to choose a paid plan for your Organization. If you're already on a paid personal plan, you'll be able to transfer your billing to your new Organization. Your personal account will switch to the Free Plan.

### How billing works between accounts

**Personal accounts:**

- **Billing applies to your personal projects:** When youâ€™re using a personal account, all billing is tied directly to you and covers your personal projects. Your paid plan covers only your personal projects.

- **Changes affect only you:** If you change your plan, it impacts just your personal account and projects. If you later switch a project to an organization, billing for that project will move to the organization.

**Organization accounts:**

- **Billing is shared:** When you create an organization, your personal plan transfers to the organization. Your personal account will switch to the Free Plan, so you can manage any new personal projects separately.

- **Admins handle billing:** In an organization, Admins manage billing. They can update payment details, view invoices, and manage the plan. Members can see the billing info, but only Admins can make changes.

See [Organization [Billing](/docs/manage/organizations#Billing) for details.
