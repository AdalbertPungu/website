The [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) allows you to share a Neon project with other Neon users. This feature is not available on the [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier).

Sharing a project with another Neon user account grants that user full access to your Neon project. The users you share a project with are able to perform any action you can perform in your Neon project, with the exception of deleting the project. For example, users you share a project with are able to:

- Create and delete branches
- Create and delete databases
- Create and delete roles
- Create and delete computes
- Modify project settings
- View data
- Run queries

You can think of sharing a Neon project as granting administrator access to your project. Only share a project with users that you trust fully with your data.

## How to share a project

Sharing a project is performed from the **Settings** page in your Neon project. For step-by-step project sharing instructions, please refer to our [Project sharing guide](/docs/guides/project-sharing-guide).
