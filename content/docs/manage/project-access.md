The [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) allows you to share a Neon project with other Neon users.

Sharing a project with another Neon user grants that user full access to your Neon project. These users are able to perform any action you can perform in the project, with the exception of deleting the project. For example, users you share a project with are able to:

- Create and delete branches
- Create and delete databases
- Create and delete roles
- Create and delete computes
- Modify project settings
- View data
- Run queries

You can think of sharing a Neon project as granting administrator access to the project.

## How to share a project

Sharing a project is performed from the **Settings** page in your Neon project. For step-by-step project sharing instructions, please refer to our [Project sharing guide](/docs/guides/project-sharing-guide).

To manage access to a database within a Neon project or objects within a database, refer to [Manage database access](/docs/manage/database-access).
