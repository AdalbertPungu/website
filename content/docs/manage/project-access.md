You to share a Neon project with other Neon users.

Users that you share a project with are able to perform any action you can perform in the project, with the exception of deleting the project. For example, users you share a project with are able to:

- Create and delete branches
- Create and delete databases
- Create and delete roles
- Create and delete computes
- Modify project settings
- View data
- Run queries

You can think of sharing a Neon project as granting administrator access to your project.

## How to share a project

Sharing a project is performed from the **Project settings** page in your Neon project.
