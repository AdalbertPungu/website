4. Upon creating a project, you are presented with the connection details for the project's default database (`neondb`). You can copy your connection details now or access them later from the **Connection details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**.

For information about managing your Neon project, refer to the [Manage Neon overview](/docs/manage/overview) section of the documentation, which includes an overview of the objects included in a Neon project.

You can query a Neon project database from the Neon SQL Editor or a client. For instructions, see:

- [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor)
- [Connect with psql](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-psql-editor)

For information about connecting to Neon from any application or client, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

Most operations supported by the Neon Console can also be performed programmatically using the [Neon API](/docs/reference/api-reference).
