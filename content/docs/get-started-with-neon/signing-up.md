You can sign up for free and upgrade to a paid plan when you are ready to scale. For information about what's included with the Neon Free Tier, see [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier). For information about Neon's paid plan options, see [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans).

Signing up for Neon is easy. Simply navigate to [https://console.neon.tech](https://console.neon.tech) and sign up with your email, Github, or Google account.

After signing up, you are directed to the Neon Console to create your first project. Enter a name for your project, select a Postgres version, provide a database name, and select a region. Generally, you'll want to select the region closest to your application. When you're finished, click **Create project**.

You are presented with the connection details for your new project, which you can use to connect to your database from a client or application. You can save the connection details or retrieve them later from the **Connection details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**.
