Suppose that you tried to populate the `elements` table with more data but you accidentally inserted several duplicate rows:

```sql
SELECT * FROM elements ORDER BY id;
```

```text
SELECT * FROM elements ORDER BY id;
 id | elementname | atomicnumber | symbol 
----+-------------+--------------+--------
  1 | Hydrogen    |            1 | H
  2 | Helium      |            2 | He

You decide to write a query to remove the duplicate rows, but your `DELETE` statement has an error that deletes a majority of your data. With Neon, you can recover from a data loss scenario like this very easily.

## Recover lost data

You can use Neon branching to recover the lost data in seconds. All you require is a point in time to recover to. Since you ran the `DELETE` query from the Neon SQL Editor, you can check the **History** for the date and time you ran the query.

![Find query time](/docs/tutorial/delete_query_time)

Now that you know when the data loss occurred, you can restore your data to a past point in time by creating a database branch.

1. Navigate to the **Branches** page in the Neon Console.
![Branches page](/docs/tutorial/branches_page.png)
1. Click **New Branch** to open the branch creation dialog.

1. Enter a name for the branch.
1. Select a parent branch. You can branch from your Neon project's [primary branch](/docs/reference/glossary/#primary-branch) (`main`) or a previously created branch.
1. Select one of the following branching options:
    - **Head**: Creates a branch with data up to the current point in time (the default).
    - **Time**: Creates a branch with data up to the specified date and time.
    - **LSN**: Creates a branch with data up to the specified [Log Sequence Number (LSN)](/docs/reference/glossary#lsn).
1. Select whether or not to create a compute endpoint, which is required to connect to the branch. If you are unsure, you can add a compute endpoint later.
1. Click **Create Branch** to create your branch.

You can optionally give a name to your branch. Make sure that the parent branch is `main` and scroll down to the `Time` option.

You should see a message similar to the one below to indicate that you successfully have created a new branch.

Letâ€™s now get back to the SQL Editor in the Neon COnsole and run the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM shoes
```

Make sure you select the newly created branch (the `backup` branch in the example below).

```text
| # |         model        | color                                          |
|---|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Air Zoom Alphafly    | Scream Green/Bright Crimson/Honeydew/Black     |
| 2 | Air Zoom Alphafly    | Scream Green/Bright Crimson/Honeydew/Black     |
| 3 | Air Zoom Alphafly    | Total Orange/Bright Crimson/Ghost Green/Black  |
```

You successfully recovered the lost data.

What have we seen here?

To recover the data, we introduced a powerful concept: branching

A Neon branch is a copy of your data that you can create from **Head** (the most up-to-date state of the database), **Time** (from a date and time, similar to the example above), or **Log-Sequence-Number (LSN)**.

An LSN is a unique identifier that is assigned to each transaction in the database, and is used to track the order in which transactions are committed to the database.

<Admonition type="note">
We recommend testing to your schema changes or manual data updates on a new branch rather than on the database branch you use for production, to avoid schema conflicts or unwanted behavior in your application.
