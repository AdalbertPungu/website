Any branch action that you can perform in the Neon Console can also be performed using the Neon API. The following examples demonstrate how to create, view, and delete branches using the Neon API. For other branch-related API methods, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://neon.tech/api-reference/).

## Prerequisites

- A Neon API request requires an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Using API Keys](/docs/get-started-with-neon/using-api-keys). In the cURL examples below, the API key is represented by `$NEON_API_KEY`. Replace this value with your API key when issuing a request.
- The API examples in this section require a `<project_id>` or `<branch_id>` value. You can find these values in the Neon Console on the **Settings** tab, under **General Settings**. Project and branch IDs generated by Neon appear similar to these: `restless-sea-792742` and `branch-broken-paper-301953`. 

## Creating a branch

The following Neon API method creates a branch:

```bash
POST /projects/{project_id}/branches
```

Specified in a cURL command, the API method appears as follows:

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/<project_id>/branches
```

## Listing branches

The following Neon API method lists branches for the specified project.

```bash
GET /projects/{project_id}/branches
```

Specified in a cURL command, the API method appears as follows:

```bash
curl -X GET -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/<project_id>/branches
```

## Deleting a branch

The following Neon API method deletes the specified branch.

```bash
DELETE /branches/{branch_id}
```

Specified in a cURL command, the API method appears as follows:

```bash
curl -X DELETE -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/branches/<branch_id>
```
