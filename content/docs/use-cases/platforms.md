Neon enables database-per-user architectures, allowing platforms to manage large fleets of databases with ease. Key features include:

- **Management API**: Provision databases at scale, set usage quotas, and track per-database metrics.
- **Instant Provisioning**: Create databases in less than a second.
- **Scale to Zero**: Idle databases automatically reduce costs by scaling compute to zero.

With Neon's serverless Postgres, you can offer budget-friendly, managed databases on your platform without the infrastructure overhead. Integrate Neon as a third-party service or build your product on top of Neon &#8212;we handle the database hosting.
