Teams building SaaS applications can accelerate development and reduce operational burden with Neon, a platform that enhances Postgres with innovative features like database branching, autoscaling, and a serverless operating model. Neon's database branching allows developers to create production-like copies of their databases instantly, streamlining development, testing, and CI/CD workflows. With autoscaling, teams only pay for the resources they need as Neon adjusts CPU, memory, and storage based on workload, reducing costs and eliminating the need for manual resizing. The serverless model further simplifies operations by removing server management tasks, enabling teams to focus on their core applications. These features combine to help teams ship software faster, more efficiently, and with greater resilience against outages during critical times.
