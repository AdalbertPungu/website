Bring isolated Postgres databases to your end-users through a Neon integration. Follow the lead of Vercel, Replit, Retool, and many others. Ideal for developers and AI agents.

- **Level up your platform**
  - Start offering managed Postgres, the most-loved database by developers.

- **Budget-friendly**
  - Thanks to scale-to-zero, empty databases cost you pennies. Pay for what you use.

- **On your terms**
  - Integrate Neon as a third-party via OAuth or build your own product on top of it.

- **Let us do the work**
  - We host Postgres, you build.
