Three features make database-per-user architectures on Neon possible to the extent that today, companies are able to manage fleets of hundreds of thousands of databases with a single engineer.

<DefinitionList>
Management API
: Use the API to provision new databases of any size, in any region, set up usage quotes, even pass through costs to end-users with detailed per-database metrics. [Neon API Reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api)

Instant Provisioning
: P99 database provisioning time is less than 1 second.

Scale to Zero
: Idle databases scale compute to zero automatically, and instantly come back online when needed. This means you're not paying a fixed cost for every database you onboard.

**The result:** Small teams can build flexible database-per-tenant architectures on Neon without operational burden or infra cost overhead.

- **Level up your platform**

  - Start offering managed Postgres, the most-loved database by developers.

- **Budget-friendly**

  - Thanks to scale-to-zero, empty databases cost you pennies. Pay for what you use.

- **On your terms**

  - Integrate Neon as a third-party via OAuth or build your own product on top of it.

- **Let us do the work**
  - We host Postgres, you build.
