### Database-per-tenant on Postgres

Neon's serverless architecture simplifies database-per-tenant designs, enabling instant provisioning and scale-to-zero for cost efficiency. With Neon's management API, you can easily provision and manage thousands of isolated databases, each scaling to zero when idle.

Key Features:
- **Management API**: Provision new databases, set usage quotas, and track detailed metrics for each tenant.
- **Instant Provisioning**: Databases are ready in under a second.
- **Scale to Zero**: Idle databases automatically reduce compute costs to zero, resuming instantly when needed.

Neon is ideal for B2B SaaS and developer platforms, supporting isolated databases per tenant to meet data privacy and regional compliance needs. Easily scale from a handful of users to hundreds of thousands with minimal operational overhead.
