### Postgres for AI Agents

Neon provides instant, serverless Postgres databases designed for AI agent development. With rapid database provisioning via API, AI agents can efficiently spin up and manage databases on demand. 

Our streamlined toolkit simplifies this process, allowing agents to focus on higher-level tasks without complex configurations. Agents can create, query, and delete databases quickly, making Neon ideal for projects requiring temporary or task-specific data handling. 

For those building AI agents, Neon offers flexible database interactions to support your agentâ€™s unique needs, with a purpose-built SDK available to facilitate development.
