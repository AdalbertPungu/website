My presentation to Prisma Day 2022 attendees in Berlin, which includes a live demo of Neon, is now available.

We made building for developer experience (DevX) our architectural driver, giving modern developers a straightforward, easy, and intuitive Postgres. We're always asking ourselves how we can advance in technology faster to make a better developer experience.

See the video for additional details and a demonstration of Neon.
