## O.5.Â `pg_receivexlog` renamed to `pg_receivewal` [#](#APP-PGRECEIVEXLOG)

PostgreSQL 9.6 and below provided a command named `pg_receivexlog` to fetch write-ahead-log (WAL) files. This command was renamed to `pg_receivewal`, see [pg_receivewal](app-pgreceivewal) for documentation of `pg_receivewal` and see [the release notes for PostgreSQL 10](release-prior) for details on this change.
