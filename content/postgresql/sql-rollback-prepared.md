## ROLLBACK PREPARED

ROLLBACK PREPARED â€” cancel a transaction that was earlier prepared for two-phase commit

## Synopsis

```
ROLLBACK PREPARED transaction_id
```

[#id](#id-1.9.3.168.5)

## Description

`ROLLBACK PREPARED` rolls back a transaction that is in prepared state.

[#id](#id-1.9.3.168.6)

## Parameters

- _`transaction_id`_

  The transaction identifier of the transaction that is to be rolled back.

[#id](#id-1.9.3.168.7)

## Notes

To roll back a prepared transaction, you must be either the same user that executed the transaction originally, or a superuser. But you do not have to be in the same session that executed the transaction.

This command cannot be executed inside a transaction block. The prepared transaction is rolled back immediately.

All currently available prepared transactions are listed in the [`pg_prepared_xacts`](view-pg-prepared-xacts) system view.

```

```

[#id](#id-1.9.3.168.9)

## Compatibility

`ROLLBACK PREPARED` is a PostgreSQL extension. It is intended for use by external transaction management systems, some of which are covered by standards (such as X/Open XA), but the SQL side of those systems is not standardized.
