## Description

`ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW` changes various auxiliary properties of an existing materialized view.

You must own the materialized view to use `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW`. To change a materialized view's schema, you must also have `CREATE` privilege on the new schema. To alter the owner, you must be able to `SET ROLE` to the new owning role, and that role must have `CREATE` privilege on the materialized view's schema. (These restrictions enforce that altering the owner doesn't do anything you couldn't do by dropping and recreating the materialized view. However, a superuser can alter ownership of any view anyway.)

The statement subforms and actions available for `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW` are a subset of those available for `ALTER TABLE`, and have the same meaning when used for materialized views. See the descriptions for [`ALTER TABLE`](sql-altertable) for details.

[#id](#id-1.9.3.19.6)

## Parameters

- _`name`_

  The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing materialized view.

- _`column_name`_

  Name of a new or existing column.

- _`extension_name`_

  The name of the extension that the materialized view is to depend on (or no longer dependent on, if `NO` is specified). A materialized view that's marked as dependent on an extension is automatically dropped when the extension is dropped.

- _`new_column_name`_

  New name for an existing column.

- _`new_owner`_

  The user name of the new owner of the materialized view.

- _`new_name`_

  The new name for the materialized view.

- _`new_schema`_

  The new schema for the materialized view.
