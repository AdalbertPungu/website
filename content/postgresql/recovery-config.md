## O.1.Â `recovery.conf` file merged into `postgresql.conf` [#](#RECOVERY-CONFIG)



PostgreSQL 11 and below used a configuration file named `recovery.conf` to manage replicas and standbys. Support for this file was removed in PostgreSQL 12. See [the release notes for PostgreSQL 12](release-prior) for details on this change.

On PostgreSQL 12 and above, [archive recovery, streaming replication, and PITR](continuous-archiving) are configured using [normal server configuration parameters](runtime-config-replication#RUNTIME-CONFIG-REPLICATION-STANDBY). These are set in `postgresql.conf` or via [ALTER SYSTEM](sql-altersystem) like any other parameter.

The server will not start if a `recovery.conf` exists.

PostgreSQL 15 and below had a setting `promote_trigger_file`, or `trigger_file` before 12. Use `pg_ctl promote` or call `pg_promote()` to promote a standby instead.

The `standby_mode` setting has been removed. A `standby.signal` file in the data directory is used instead. See [Standby Server Operation](warm-standby#STANDBY-SERVER-OPERATION) for details.
