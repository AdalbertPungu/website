## O.3.Â `pg_xlogdump` renamed to `pg_waldump` [#](#PGXLOGDUMP)

PostgreSQL 9.6 and below provided a command named `pg_xlogdump` to read write-ahead-log (WAL) files. This command was renamed to `pg_waldump`, see [pg_waldump](pgwaldump) for documentation of `pg_waldump` and see [the release notes for PostgreSQL 10](release-prior) for details on this change.
