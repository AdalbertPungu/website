## 53.11. `pg_class` [#](#CATALOG-PG-CLASS)



The catalog `pg_class` catalogs tables and most everything else that has columns or is otherwise similar to a table. This includes indexes (but see also [`pg_index`](catalog-pg-index)), sequences (but see also [`pg_sequence`](catalog-pg-sequence)), views, materialized views, composite types, and TOAST tables; see `relkind`. Below, when we mean all of these kinds of objects we speak of “relations”. Not all columns are meaningful for all relation types.

| `relam` `oid` (references [`pg_am`](catalog-pg-am).`oid`)If this is a table or an index, the access method used (heap, B-tree, hash, etc.); otherwise zero (zero occurs for sequences, as well as relations without storage, such as views)                                                                                                                                  |
| `relfilenode` `oid`Name of the on-disk file of this relation; zero means this is a “mapped” relation whose disk file name is determined by low-level state                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `reltablespace` `oid` (references [`pg_tablespace`](catalog-pg-tablespace).`oid`)The tablespace in which this relation is stored. If zero, the database's default tablespace is implied. (Not meaningful if the relation has no on-disk file.)                                                                                                                               |
| `relpages` `int4`Size of the on-disk representation of this table in pages (of size `BLCKSZ`). This is only an estimate used by the planner. It is updated by [`VACUUM`](sql-vacuum), [`ANALYZE`](sql-analyze), and a few DDL commands such as [`CREATE INDEX`](sql-createindex).                                                                                  |
| `reltuples` `float4`Number of live rows in the table. This is only an estimate used by the planner. It is updated by [`VACUUM`](sql-vacuum), [`ANALYZE`](sql-analyze), and a few DDL commands such as [`CREATE INDEX`](sql-createindex). If the table has never yet been vacuumed or analyzed, `reltuples` contains `-1` indicating that the row count is unknown. |
| `relallvisible` `int4`Number of pages that are marked all-visible in the table's visibility map. This is only an estimate used by the planner. It is updated by [`VACUUM`](sql-vacuum), [`ANALYZE`](sql-analyze), and a few DDL commands such as [`CREATE INDEX`](sql-createindex).                                                                                |
| `reltoastrelid` `oid` (references [`pg_class`](catalog-pg-class).`oid`)OID of the TOAST table associated with this table, zero if none.

| `relisshared` `bool`True if this table is shared across all databases in the cluster. Only certain system catalogs (such as [`pg_database`](catalog-pg-database)) are shared.                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| `relrewrite` `oid` (references [`pg_class`](catalog-pg-class).`oid`)For new relations being written during a DDL operation that requires a table rewrite, this contains the OID of the original relation; otherwise zero. That state is only visible internally; this field should never contain anything other than zero for a user-visible relation.                       |
| `relfrozenxid` `xid`All transaction IDs before this one have been replaced with a permanent (“frozen”) transaction ID in this table. This is used to track whether the table needs to be vacuumed in order to prevent transaction ID wraparound or to allow `pg_xact` to be shrunk. Zero (`InvalidTransactionId`) if the relation is not a table.                                 |
| `relminmxid` `xid`All multixact IDs before this one have been replaced by a transaction ID in this table. This is used to track whether the table needs to be vacuumed in order to prevent multixact ID wraparound or to allow `pg_multixact` to be shrunk.

Several of the Boolean flags in `pg_class` are maintained lazily: they are guaranteed to be true if that's the correct state, but may not be reset to false immediately when the condition is no longer true. For example, `relhasindex` is set by [`CREATE INDEX`](sql-createindex), but it is never cleared by [`DROP INDEX`](sql-dropindex). Instead, [`VACUUM`](sql-vacuum) clears `relhasindex` if it finds the table has no indexes. This arrangement avoids race conditions and improves concurrency.
