[#id](#SQL-DROPSCHEMA)

## DROP SCHEMA

DROP SCHEMA — remove a schema

## Synopsis

```
DROP SCHEMA [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

[#id](#id-1.9.3.129.5)

## Description

`DROP SCHEMA` removes schemas from the database.

A schema can only be dropped by its owner or a superuser. Note that the owner can drop the schema (and thereby all contained objects) even if they do not own some of the objects within the schema.

[#id](#id-1.9.3.129.6)

## Parameters

* `IF EXISTS`

  Do not throw an error if the schema does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

* *`name`*

  The name of a schema.

* `CASCADE`

  Automatically drop objects (tables, functions, etc.) that are contained in the schema, and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see [Section 5.14](ddl-depend)).

* `RESTRICT`

  Refuse to drop the schema if it contains any objects. This is the default.

[#id](#id-1.9.3.129.7)

## Notes

Using the `CASCADE` option might make the command remove objects in other schemas besides the one(s) named.

## Examples

To remove schema `mystuff` from the database, along with everything it contains:

```
DROP SCHEMA mystuff CASCADE;
```

[#id](#id-1.9.3.129.9)

## Compatibility

`DROP SCHEMA` is fully conforming with the SQL standard, except that the standard only allows one schema to be dropped per command, and apart from the `IF EXISTS` option, which is a PostgreSQL extension.
