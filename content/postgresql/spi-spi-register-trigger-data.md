## Description

`SPI_register_trigger_data` makes any ephemeral relations captured by a trigger available to queries planned and executed through the current SPI connection. Currently, this means the transition tables captured by an `AFTER` trigger defined with a `REFERENCING OLD/NEW TABLE AS` ... clause. This function should be called by a PL trigger handler function after connecting.

- `SPI_OK_TD_REGISTER`

  if the captured trigger data (if any) has been successfully registered

On error, one of the following negative values is returned:

- `SPI_ERROR_ARGUMENT`

  if _`tdata`_ is `NULL`

- `SPI_ERROR_UNCONNECTED`

  if called from an unconnected C function
