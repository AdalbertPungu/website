## DO

DO â€” execute an anonymous code block

## Synopsis

```
DO [ LANGUAGE lang_name ] code
```

[#id](#id-1.9.3.102.6)

## Description

`DO` executes an anonymous code block, or in other words a transient anonymous function in a procedural language.

The code block is treated as though it were the body of a function with no parameters, returning `void`. It is parsed and executed a single time.

The optional `LANGUAGE` clause can be written either before or after the code block.

[#id](#id-1.9.3.102.7)

## Parameters

* *`code`*

  The procedural language code to be executed. This must be specified as a string literal, just as in `CREATE FUNCTION`. Use of a dollar-quoted literal is recommended.

* *`lang_name`*

  The name of the procedural language the code is written in. If omitted, the default is `plpgsql`.

[#id](#id-1.9.3.102.8)

## Notes

The procedural language to be used must already have been installed into the current database by means of `CREATE EXTENSION`. `plpgsql` is installed by default, but other languages are not.

The user must have `USAGE` privilege for the procedural language, or must be a superuser if the language is untrusted. This is the same privilege requirement as for creating a function in the language.

If `DO` is executed in a transaction block, then the procedure code cannot execute transaction control statements. Transaction control statements are only allowed if `DO` is executed in its own transaction.

## Examples

Grant all privileges on all views in schema `public` to role `webuser`:

```
DO $$DECLARE r record;
BEGIN
    FOR r IN SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables
             WHERE table_type = 'VIEW' AND table_schema = 'public'
    LOOP
        EXECUTE 'GRANT ALL ON ' || quote_ident(r.table_schema) || '.' || quote_ident(r.table_name) || ' TO webuser';
    END LOOP;
END$$;
```

## Compatibility

There is no `DO` statement in the SQL standard.
