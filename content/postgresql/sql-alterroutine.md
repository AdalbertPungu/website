## Description

`ALTER ROUTINE` changes the definition of a routine, which can be an aggregate function, a normal function, or a procedure. See under [ALTER AGGREGATE](sql-alteraggregate), [ALTER FUNCTION](sql-alterfunction), and [ALTER PROCEDURE](sql-alterprocedure) for the description of the parameters, more examples, and further details.

## Examples

To rename the routine `foo` for type `integer` to `foobar`:

```
ALTER ROUTINE foo(integer) RENAME TO foobar;
```

This command will work independent of whether `foo` is an aggregate, function, or procedure.

## Compatibility

This statement is partially compatible with the `ALTER ROUTINE` statement in the SQL standard. See under [ALTER FUNCTION](sql-alterfunction) and [ALTER PROCEDURE](sql-alterprocedure) for more details. Allowing routine names to refer to aggregate functions is a PostgreSQL extension.
