## 53.38. `pg_policy` [#](#CATALOG-PG-POLICY)



The catalog `pg_policy` stores row-level security policies for tables. A policy includes the kind of command that it applies to (possibly all commands), the roles that it applies to, the expression to be added as a security-barrier qualification to queries that include the table, and the expression to be added as a `WITH CHECK` option for queries that attempt to add new records to the table.
