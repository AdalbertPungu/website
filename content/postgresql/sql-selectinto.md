## SELECT INTO

SELECT INTO — define a new table from the results of a query

## Synopsis

```
[ WITH [ RECURSIVE ] with_query [, ...] ]
SELECT [ ALL | DISTINCT [ ON ( expression [, ...] ) ] ]
    * | expression [ [ AS ] output_name ] [, ...]
    INTO [ TEMPORARY | TEMP | UNLOGGED ] [ TABLE ] new_table
    [ FROM from_item [, ...] ]
    [ WHERE condition ]
    [ GROUP BY expression [, ...] ]
    [ HAVING condition ]
    [ WINDOW window_name AS ( window_definition ) [, ...] ]
    [ { UNION | INTERSECT | EXCEPT } [ ALL | DISTINCT ] select ]
    [ ORDER BY expression [ ASC | DESC | USING operator ] [ NULLS { FIRST | LAST } ] [, ...] ]
    [ LIMIT { count | ALL } ]
    [ OFFSET start [ ROW | ROWS ] ]
    [ FETCH { FIRST | NEXT } [ count ] { ROW | ROWS } ONLY ]
    [ FOR { UPDATE | SHARE } [ OF table_name [, ...] ] [ NOWAIT ] [...] ]
```

## Description

`SELECT INTO` creates a new table and fills it with data computed by a query. The data is not returned to the client, as it is with a normal `SELECT`. The new table's columns have the names and data types associated with the output columns of the `SELECT`.

[#id](#id-1.9.3.173.6)

## Parameters

* `TEMPORARY` or `TEMP`

  If specified, the table is created as a temporary table. Refer to [CREATE TABLE](sql-createtable) for details.

* `UNLOGGED`

  If specified, the table is created as an unlogged table. Refer to [CREATE TABLE](sql-createtable) for details.

* *`new_table`*

  The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table to be created.

All other parameters are described in detail under [SELECT](sql-select).

## Notes

[`CREATE TABLE AS`](sql-createtableas) is functionally similar to `SELECT INTO`. `CREATE TABLE AS` is the recommended syntax, since this form of `SELECT INTO` is not available in ECPG or PL/pgSQL, because they interpret the `INTO` clause differently. Furthermore, `CREATE TABLE AS` offers a superset of the functionality provided by `SELECT INTO`.

In contrast to `CREATE TABLE AS`, `SELECT INTO` does not allow specifying properties like a table's access method with [`USING method`](sql-createtable#SQL-CREATETABLE-METHOD) or the table's tablespace with [`TABLESPACE tablespace_name`](sql-createtable#SQL-CREATETABLE-TABLESPACE). Use `CREATE TABLE AS` if necessary. Therefore, the default table access method is chosen for the new table. See [default\_table\_access\_method](runtime-config-client#GUC-DEFAULT-TABLE-ACCESS-METHOD) for more information.

## Examples

Create a new table `films_recent` consisting of only recent entries from the table `films`:

```
SELECT * INTO films_recent FROM films WHERE date_prod >= '2002-01-01';
```

## Compatibility

The SQL standard uses `SELECT INTO` to represent selecting values into scalar variables of a host program, rather than creating a new table. This indeed is the usage found in ECPG (see [Chapter 36](ecpg)) and PL/pgSQL (see [Chapter 43](plpgsql)). The PostgreSQL usage of `SELECT INTO` to represent table creation is historical. Some other SQL implementations also use `SELECT INTO` in this way (but most SQL implementations support `CREATE TABLE AS` instead). Apart from such compatibility considerations, it is best to use `CREATE TABLE AS` for this purpose in new code.
