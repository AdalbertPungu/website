DROP STATISTICS â€” remove extended statistics

## Synopsis

```
DROP STATISTICS [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

[#id](#id-1.9.3.132.5)

## Description

`DROP STATISTICS` removes statistics object(s) from the database. Only the statistics object's owner, the schema owner, or a superuser can drop a statistics object.

[#id](#id-1.9.3.132.6)

## Parameters

* `IF EXISTS`

  Do not throw an error if the statistics object does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

* *`name`*

  The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the statistics object to drop.

* `CASCADE``RESTRICT`

  These key words do not have any effect, since there are no dependencies on statistics.

    accounting.users_uid_creation,
