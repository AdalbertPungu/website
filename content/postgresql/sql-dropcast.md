DROP CAST â€” remove a cast

## Synopsis

```
DROP CAST [ IF EXISTS ] (source_type AS target_type) [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

## Description

`DROP CAST` removes a previously defined cast.

To be able to drop a cast, you must own the source or the target data type. These are the same privileges that are required to create a cast.

  The name of the source data type of the cast.

* *`target_type`*

  The name of the target data type of the cast.
