## 53.35. `pg_opfamily` [#](#CATALOG-PG-OPFAMILY)



The catalog `pg_opfamily` defines operator families. Each operator family is a collection of operators and associated support routines that implement the semantics specified for a particular index access method. Furthermore, the operators in a family are all “compatible”, in a way that is specified by the access method. The operator family concept allows cross-data-type operators to be used with indexes and to be reasoned about using knowledge of access method semantics.

Operator families are described at length in [Section 38.16](xindex).

The majority of the information defining an operator family is not in its `pg_opfamily` row, but in the associated rows in [`pg_amop`](catalog-pg-amop), [`pg_amproc`](catalog-pg-amproc), and [`pg_opclass`](catalog-pg-opclass).
