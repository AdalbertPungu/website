### What's new

- Pageserver: Added support for on-demand download of layer files, which enables fast redistribution of tenant data across Pageservers and recovery from local state loss. This feature augments Neon's cold data storage capability by allowing the data to be restored when it is needed.

Question about the entry above:

- In terms users can understand, what are "layer files"?
- What do we mean by "local state loss"? Is this a Neon Pageserver failure?
- In general, how and why is cold storage of data important? Do we cold-store data that has not been used after a period of time? What period of time is that?
