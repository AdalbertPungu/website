### What's New

- Added an [SDKs](/docs/reference/sdk) reference page, which provides links to community-created SDKs for interacting with the Neon API. Community-created SDKs include:
  - [Go SDK](https://github.com/kislerdm/neon-sdk-go)
  - [Node and Deno TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/paambaati/neon-js-sdk)  
  Thanks to [Dmitry Kisler](https://github.com/kislerdm) and [Ganesh Prasannah](https://github.com/paambaati) for the contributions.
- Redirected links to the old Neon API reference to the new [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).
- Updated various [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api) style elements to align them with the [Neon Docs](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction) site.  
- Added a [Billing)(/docs/introduction/billing) page describing Neon paid plans, pricing, and related topics.
- Updated the [Neon Docs](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction) landing page. The new landing page improves navigation, allowing users to quickly find the documentation they are looking for.
- Updated the query example in the Neon Console onboarding banner and in the [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor) topic in the documentation. The `CREATE TABLE` statement did not include a primary key, which prevented the data from being edited when accessed from pgAdmin.
