### Fixes & improvements

- UI: Simplified the design of the Neon sign-in page.
- UI: Improved the **Pro Plan Cost Estimation** tool for Neon Free Tier users. To improve accuracy, the tool now displays cost estimates only after following conditions are met:

  - Your account has been registered for at least one month.
  - You have a Neon project that was created more than a month ago.

  This change prevents the display of inaccurate cost estimates for new accounts. Neon Free Tier users can access the **Pro Plan Cost Estimation** tool by visiting the **Billing** page in the Neon Console.
