### Fixes & improvements

- UI: Fixed an issue that appended a Neon user account's email domain (e.g., `@domain.com`) to the name of the default Postgres role created with a new project. This issue occured for users who signed up for Neon using an email account. 
- UI: Fixed an issue preventing older projects from storing passwords, resulting in the following error when attempting to view a password in the **Connection Details** widget: `Request failed: storing passwords is not enabled for a project`.
- UI: Corrected a Java code snippet highlighting issue in the **Connection Details** widget.
- UI: Corrected an SQL syntax highlighting issue in the **Neon SQL Editor**.
- UI: Fixed an issue with the **History retention** slider on the **Storage** page in the project's settings. Specifying 0 would set the value to the 7-day history retention default.
- UI: Fixed an issue that left a Neon project visible in the dashboard after being deleted from another instance of the Neon Console.
