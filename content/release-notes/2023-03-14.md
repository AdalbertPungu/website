### Bug Fixes

- Control Plane: Addressed an issue with the Activity Monitor that caused unexpected CPU usage. The Activity Monitor is a process that monitors Neon compute endpoints for activity.
- Control Plane: Addressed a memory leak that affected Neon Console performance. A memory limit was put in place prevent similar issues.
- UI: Fixed the connection examples accessible from the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. All examples other than the `psql` example had an extra project name in the connection hostname.
