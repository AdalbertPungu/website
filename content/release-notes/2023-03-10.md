### What's new

- API: Removed the `physical_size` property from the Branch response body in the Neon API.
- Control Plane: Reduced the number of queries performed by the Activity Monitor to optimize performance. The Activity Monitor is a process that monitors Neon compute endpoints for activity.
- UI: Changed the **User** label on the **Connection Details** widget to **Roles**. Database users are now referred to as **Roles** in Neon.
- UI: Added descriptive text and a documentation link to the **Integrations** page in the Neon Console.

### Bug Fixes

- UI: Fixed the **Manage** in the **Branches** widget on the Neon Dashboard. The link did not work.
