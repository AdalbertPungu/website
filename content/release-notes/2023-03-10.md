### What's New

- Added a [SDKs](/docs/reference/sdk) reference page, which provides links to community-created SDKs for interacting with the Neon API. Community-created SDKs include:
  - [Go SDK](https://github.com/kislerdm/neon-sdk-go)
  - [Node and Deno TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/paambaati/neon-js-sdk)  
  Thanks to [Dmitry Kisler](https://github.com/kislerdm) and [Ganesh Prasannah](https://github.com/paambaati) for the contributions.
- All links to our old Neon API reference are now redirected to the new and improved [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).
