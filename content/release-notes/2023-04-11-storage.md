### What's new

- Pageserver: Added `disk_size` and `instance_type` properties to the Pageserver API. This data is required to support assigning Pageserver storage to projects based on Pageserver disk usage.
- Safekeeper: The `wal_backup_lsn` is now advanced after each WAL segment is offload to storage to avoid lags in WAL segment cleanup.
- Proxy: Added error reporting for unusually low `proxy_io_bytes_per_client` metric values.
- Safekeeper: Enabled a timeout for reading from the socket in the Safekeeper WAL service to avoid an accumulation of waiting threads.

### Bu fixes:

- Proxy: The passwordless authentication proxy ignored non-wildcard common names, passing a `None` value instead. A non-wildcard common names is now set and an error is reported if a `None` value is passed.
