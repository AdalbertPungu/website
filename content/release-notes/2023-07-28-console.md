### What's new

- UI: Added a billing period selector to the **Billing** page for Neon Pro accounts. The selector, positioned at the top of the **Billing** page, allows you to view billing metrics for current and past billing periods.

### Bug fixes

- UI: Fixed the password reveal functionality on the connection details modal that is displayed immediately after creating a new branch. The password was not revealed when selected, resulting in a branch connection string without a password.
- UI: Fixed a number of dark mode styling issues in the Neon UI and Neon-Vercel integration UI.
