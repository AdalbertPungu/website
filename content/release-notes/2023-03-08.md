### What's New

- Released a new version of the [Neon serverless driver](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless) (v0.2.6). The driver allows you to query data from Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge Functions, and other environments that support WebSockets — places where TCP sockets are not available. In this new version, the driver:
  - Automatically imports the `ws` (WebSocket library) package if it's needed and available — which makes the driver easier to use on StackBlitz and with Zapatos, for example.
  - Provides more helpful error messages when no connection details are provided. For example, a more informative error message is provided you forget to set an environment variable for the database connection or when you forget to include a password in the database connection string.
- In addition, three new example repositories to help you get started with the Neon serverless driver with Vercel, Zapatos, and Kysely:
