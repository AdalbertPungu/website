### Fixes & improvements

- UI: Improvements to the connection snippets that display on the [Connection Details](/docs/connect-from-any-app) pane:
  - A new eye icon lets you show/hide the password in all connection snippets. This affects visual display only; if you copy a snippet, the password is always included.
  - For your convenience, all connection snippets now include <code>sslmode=require</code> by default.

  These changes apply wherever the Connection Details pane appears: on the Dashboard page, when you create a branch, and when you create a project.
