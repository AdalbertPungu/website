### What's New

- UI: Added **Pooler enabled** toggle to the endpoint editing popup.
- UI: Completely switched to API v2.
- UI: Added **Region** column to the projects list screen.
- UI: Significantly improved integration with WebSocket updates. Now UI also receives updates for endpoints.
- API: `branch_logical_size_limit` was added to the [project response](https://neon.tech/api-reference/v2/#/Project) and `logical_size_limit` was removed from the [branch response](https://neon.tech/api-reference/v2/#/Branch).
- API: Added possibility to delete endpoint or change `branch_id` of the endpoint on root branch.
- API: Updated [Swagger reference](https://neon.tech/api-reference/v2/) descriptions and examples.
- Control Plane: Migrated all old branches created via v1 API as separated projects to their parent projects as v2 branch and endpoint objects. Connection strings with old `project_id` in the hostname will stop working. Please, use `endpoint_id` instead. Corresponding emails with migration instruction have been sent to all affected users.

### Bug Fixes

- UI: Fixed displaying password in the **Connection Details** widget on the project **Dashboard** after project creation and password reset.
- API: Added validation on the role name length (63 bytes). Longer role names were causing compute startup issues.
