### What's new

- Control Plane: The polling interval for a branch deletion operation was decreased from approximately 20 seconds to 1 second. A branch deletion operation typically takes a few seconds but appeared to take longer due to the long polling delay.

### Bug fixes

- UI: Fixed the code example copy button in the **Connection Details** widget, which failed to remain stationary when scrolling.
