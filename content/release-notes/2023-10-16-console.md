### Fixes & improvements

UI: Added new fields for configuring the Auto-suspend delay period for Neon compute instances, allowing you to specify the delay period in seconds, minutes, hours or days.

Neon's Auto-suspend feature automatically transitions a compute endpoint into an `Idle` state after a period of inactivity, also known as "scale-to-zero". By default, suspension occurs after 5 minutes of inactivity. [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users can configure the Auto-suspend setting when creating a project, changing default compute settings, creating a compute endpoint, or editing a compute endpoint.

For more information about this feature, see [Auto-suspend](/docs/introduction/auto-suspend).
