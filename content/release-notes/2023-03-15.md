### What's new

- UI: In addition to our Free Tier, Neon now offers the following paid plans:
  
  - **Pro**: A usage-based plan, ideal for small-to-medium teams. With the Pro plan, you can share projects with anyone, and you only pay for what you use.
  - **Enterprise**: A volume-based plan for medium-to-large teams and database fleets. Includes all Pro plan features, customized limits, and potential for volume-based discounts.
  - **Platform Partnership**: A volume-based plan for large teams, database fleets, and resale. Includes all Enterprise plan features  plus resale support.

  You can learn more about Neon's paid plans on our [Billing](/docs/introduction/billing) page.
