### What's new

- UI: In addition to our Free Tier, Neon now offers the following paid plans:
  
  - **Pro**: A usage-based plan, ideal for small-to-medium teams. With the Pro plan, you can share projects with anyone, and you only pay for what you use.
  - **Enterprise**: A volume-based plan for medium-to-large teams and database fleets. Includes all Pro plan features, customized limits, and potential for volume-based discounts.
  - **Platform Partnership**: A volume-based plan for large teams, database fleets, and resale. Includes all Enterprise plan features  plus resale support.

  You can learn more about Neon's paid plans on our [Billing](/docs/introduction/billing) page.
  
- UI: Neon now supports sharing projects with other Neon users. Project sharing is performed from the **Settings** page in the Neon Console. For instructions, see [Manage projects](/docs/manage/projects). Neon's project sharing feature is available to Neon paid-plan users, but projects can be shared with any Neon user, including Free Tier users.
- UI: Added an **Upgrade to Pro** button to the Neon Console to enable upgrading from Free Tier to Neon's Pro plan.
