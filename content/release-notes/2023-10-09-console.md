### Fixes & improvements

- UI: Added timestamp validation for branch creation to prevent selecting a time before a Neon project was created and before the history retention period. The new validation also prevents selecting a time in the future. Neon supports creating point-in-time branches, but the selected time must be in the past and within the history retention window. For more information, see [Point-in-time restore](/docs/introduction/point-in-time-restore).
- UI: Fixed an issue on the **Tables** page in the Neon console that caused a `relation does not exist` error when viewing table data and then selecting a different database.
- UI: Addressed error handling issues in the [Neon-Vercel integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon).
