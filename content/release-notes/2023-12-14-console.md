## Quickstart

We've revised the **Quickstart** panel that appears at the top of the Neon project **Dashboard** after creating a new project. Follow the Quickstart to learn about [passwordless authentication](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/passwordless-connect), installing the [Neon CLI](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/neon-cli), integrating your apps with Neon, and how to import data.

### Fixes & improvements

- Fixed the **Create Support Ticket** for that is accessed from the **Support** link in the Neon Console sidebar. The form was not functioning properly.
- Fixed the **Cancel** action in the drawer that opens when requesting an integration on the Integrations page in the Neon Console. Click Cancel now closed the drawer, as expected.
