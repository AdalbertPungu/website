### What's New

- Neon now supports connections from the [Postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) client for Node.js and Deno. Postgres.js recently added [support for Server Name Indication (SNI)]((https://neon.tech/docs/reference/glossary#sni)(https://github.com/porsager/postgres/commit/498f2aec9fa2abe7da548865abffb148ba438946)), which Neon uses to route incoming connections. For more information about how Neon uses SNI, see [How Neon routes connections](/docs/connect/connectivity-issues#how-neon-routes-connections).
