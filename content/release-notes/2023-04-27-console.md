### What's new

- API: Enabled example checking for the Neon API specification to ensure that examples in the Neon API reference are updated when the specification is modified.
- API: Added a `history_retention_seconds` property to the Project response body. This property reports the history retention period, which is currently 7 days. The history retention period will become a configurable parameter in a future release.
- API: Increased the maximum value of the `suspend_timeout_seconds` property in the `Endpoint` schema to 604800 seconds (7 days). Previously, the maximum value was 86400 seconds (1 day). This API change affects the maximum **Auto-suspend delay** setting in the UI, which you can configure when creating or editing a compute endpoint. The **Auto-suspend** delay setting defines the number of seconds of activity after which a compute endpoint is automatically suspended. The default is 300 seconds (5 minutes). For more information, see [Auto-suspend configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#auto-suspend-configuration).
- UI: Redesigned the page displayed when selecting a branch from the **Branches** page in the Neon Console. In addition to the branch information displayed previously, branch pages now provide usage metrics, including **Active Time**, **Compute Time**, **Written Data**, and **Data Transfer**_. This information enables you to monitor usage for each branch and understand how branch usage affects billing. Refer to the [Billing](/docs/introduction/billing) section for information on Neon usage and billing metrics. Compute endpoint information on branch pages has also been expanded to include the **Compute size**, **Auto-suspend delay**, and **Last active** date and time. **Compute size (min)** and **Compute size (max)** values are shown for computes with the Autoscaling feature enabled. For related information, see [View a compute endpoint](/docs/manage/endpoints#view-a-compute-endpoint).

- UI: Added an **Active time** column to the table on the **Branches** page in the Neon Console. This column shows the number of hours the branch's compute endpoint has been active in the current month.
- UI: The **Connection Details** dialog displayed when creating a project or a branch now provides **Pooled connection** and **Direct connection** tabs, allowing you to copy a pooled or direct connection string for the default `neondb` database.

  For information about connection pooling in Neon, see [Connection pooling](/docs/connection/connection-pooling).
- UI: Updated the `prisma.js` code example accessible from the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. The connection string now includes a `connect_timeout` parameter to prevent Prisma from timing out due to cold starts, and a `pgbouncer=true` parameter, which is required when using Prisma with a pooled connection string. For more information about using Neon with Prisma, see [Connect Neon to Prisma](/docs/guides/prisma).
Control Plane: Added a constraint to ensure that the maximum autoscaling compute size is greater than or equal to the minimum compute size.
- UI: Added icons and hover help to the **Usage** widget on the Neon Console.
