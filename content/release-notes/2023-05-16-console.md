### What's new

- Control Plane: Ensured that project limit checks are performed for the Neon project owner rather than the currently logged in user. Pro plan users are able to share Neon projects with Free Tier users. In these cases, project limits should be checked against Pro plan limits rather than Free Tier limits.
- UI: Implemented usability improvements for modals. The changes ensure that modals receive focus when opened and that modal buttons are disabled until there is a change to submit and while a form is being submitted. New error messages were added.
- Control Plane: Newly created Neon projects in a particular region are now assigned Pageservers through a weighted random selection process, where selection is weighted according to Pageserver free space.

### Bug fixes

- Control Plane: Neon plan limits are now transmitted when using [passwordless authentication](/docs/connect/passwordless-connect), enabling users logging in via this method to create projects in Neon.
- API: The [Update endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateprojectendpoint) API now permits moving an endpoint from one branch to another without specifying `autoscaling_limit_max_cu` and `autoscaling_limit_min_cu` values.
