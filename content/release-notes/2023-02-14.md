### What's new

- Compute: Added support for the the PostgreSQL `pgvector`, `plls` and `plcoffee` extensions. For more information about PostgreSQL extensions supported by Neon, see [PostgreSQL extensions](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/pg-extensions/).
- Proxy: Significantly reduced network latencies for WebSocket and pooled connections by implementing caching mechanism for compute node connection information and enabling the `TCP_NODELAY` protocol option. The `TCP_NODELAY` option causes segments to be sent as soon as possible, even if there is only a small amount of data. For more information, refer to the [TCP protocol man page](https://linux.die.net/man/7/tcp).
- Pageserver: Added an opt-in feature for automatically evicting layer files from Pageservers to optimize local storage space usage. If enabled for a given project, Pageserver periodically checks the access timestamps of the project's layer files. Suppose the most recent access to a layer file is further in the past than a configurable threshold. In that case, Pageserver removes its local copy of the layer file. The authoritative copy remains in S3. It is downloaded on-demand if the layer is needed again, e.g., to reconstruct a page version for a client request.
