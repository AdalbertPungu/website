### Fixes & improvements

- UI: We've made some updates to the **Create Support Ticket** modal available via the Support link in the Neon Console sidebar. Here's what's new:

  - Introduced a **Business Impact Statement** field: This allows users to detail how an issue affects their business, enabling the Neon Support team to prioritize requests effectively.
  - Added a consent checkbox: By ticking the checkbox, users grant Neon employees permission to connect to their databases for support purposes. This streamlines the troubleshooting process, ensuring quicker resolutions.
