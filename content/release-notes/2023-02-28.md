  - `hypopg`
  - Server Programming Interface (SPI) extensions:

- Compute: Updated supported PostgreSQL versions to 14.7 and 15.2, respectively.
- Pageserver: Optimized the log structured merge tree (LSM tree) implementation to reduce write amplification, which causes the actual amount of data physically written to storage to be multiple of the logical amount that was intended to be written.
