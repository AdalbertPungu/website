## Deploy a global cache with Neon's PolyScale integration

We're excited to announce the launch of Neon's PolyScale integration. [PolyScale](https://docs.polyscale.ai/) allows you to easily cache your data globally through its low-latency [regional edge network](https://docs.polyscale.ai/edge-network-and-security/#regional-edge-network). Enjoy benefits like speedy accces to your data from anywhere in the world, reduced load on your database, and improved slow query performance. A PolyScale global cache is also an alternative to cross-regional replication without the added complexity. No coding or infrastructure changes are required. To get started, see our [PolyScale integration](/docs/guides/polyscale-integration) guide. Like Neon, PolyScale offers a free plan. No credit card is required.
