## Deploy a global cache with Neon's PolyScale integration

We're excited to announce the launch of Neon's PolyScale integration. This new feature lets you set up a global cache for your Neon database with just a few clicks. PolyScale's low-latency edge network enables quick access your data from anywhere in the world. Enjoy benefits like reduced load on your database and improved slow query performance. A PolyScale global cache is also an alternative to cross-regional replication, without the added complexity. No coding or infrastructure changes are required. To get started, check out our [PolyScale integration](/docs/guides/polyscale-integration) guide. Like Neon, PolyScale offers a free plan. No credit card is required.
