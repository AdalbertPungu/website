### Bug Fixes

- Storage: the resident physical size Prometheus metric would overflow if an evicted layer got garbage-collected.
- Storage: index upload would be skipped if compaction didn't do any on-demand downloads.
  This self-corrects at the next level 0 delta layer write.
  A symptom of this was the the remote physical size metric didn't increment.
