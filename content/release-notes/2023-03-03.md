### Bug Fixes

- Pageserver: A system metric that monitors physical data size overflowed when a garbage collection operation was performed on an evicted data layer.
- Pageserver: An index upload was skipped when a compaction operation did not perform any on-demand downloads from storage. The compaction function would exit early without scheduling the index upload.
