### What's new

- UI: Updated the the labels, links, and units shown on the **Project limits** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**.

### Bug Fixes

- API: Adjusted the tags in the Neon API specification that assign endpoints to categories. The new [Neon API reference](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/api-reference) displays one endpoint per page. Multiple tags assigned to an endpoint resulted in endpoints not being listed under their primary category.
- UI: Fixed the vertical alignment of buttons on authorization dialogs.
- UI: Adjusted the logic supporting the **Integrations** page in the Neon Console, where you can view and revoke integrations, to only mark Vercel projects as revoked rather than deleting them.
- UI: Adjusted the confirm settings dialog in the [Neon Vercel Integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon) to ensure that the password reset warning remains visible when scrolling.
- UI: Removed a newline character from the connection string in the connection details dialog that is displayed after creating a new project.
