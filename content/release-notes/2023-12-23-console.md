description: Introducing IP Allow and Logical Replication

### IP Allow 

![Neon IP Allow banner image](/docs/relnotes/neon-ip-allow.jpg)

Neon's **IP Allow** feature, now available with the [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan), ensures that only trusted IP addresses can connect to the project where your database resides, preventing unauthorized access and helping maintain overall data security. You can limit access to individual IP addresses, IP ranges, or IP addreses and ranges defined with [CIDR notation](/docs/reference/glossary#cidr-notation). 

To get started, see [Configure IP Allow](/docs/manage/projects#configure-ip-allow).

### Logical replication

Neon is pleased to announce support for logical replication, which brings Change Data Capture (CDC) to serverless Postgres. You can now stream data from your Neon databasee to a variety of external destinations, including data warehouses, analytical database services, messaging platforms, event-streaming platforms, and external Postgres databases. Logical replication is available to all Neon users.

To get started, jump into one of our step-by-step logical replication guides:

- [Replicate data with Kafka (Confluent) and Debezium](/docs/guides/logical-replication-kafka-confluent)
- [Replicate data to Materialize](/docs/guides/logical-replication-materialize)
- [Replicate data to an external Postgres instance](/docs/guides/logical-replication-postgres)

### Neon Vercel Integration improvements

The following changes were made to the [Neon Vercel Integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon): 

- To ensure that users of the integration that access Neon from Vercel's serverless environment do not run out connections, the `DATABASE_URL` and `PGHOST` environment variables added to a Vercel project by the Neon integration are now set to a pooled Neon connection string by default. With a pooled connection string, connection requests are served by Neon's PgBouncer connection pooler, which supports up to 10,000 simultaneous connections. Previously, these variables were set to an unpooled connection string, causing some users to run out of available connections.
  A new environment variable named `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` was added, which is set to the unpooled Neon connection string.
  For information about connection pooling in Neon and "pooled" vs "unpooled" connections strings, see [Connection pooling](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/connection-pooling).
