### What's new

- Pageserver/Safekeeper/Compute/Proxy: Make storage binaries smaller by removing dependecies debug symbols from the release build. This reduces the size of the binaries by 50%.
- Pageserver: Extract walredo code from postgres repository to our extension and create a separate `WalRedo` binary for it. It reduces diff in the postgres codebase.
- Compute: Added prefetching support to improve seqscan performance. This is disabled by default, but can be enabled by using `set enable_seqscan_prefetch = on; set seqscan_prefetch_buffers = 100;`.
- Pageserver/Safekeeper: Remove support for `--daemonize` option in CLI.
- Pageserver: Add `/v1/tenant/:tenant_id/size` endpoint to get the size of the tenant.
