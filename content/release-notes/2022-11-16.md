### What's new

- Pageserver, Safekeeper, Compute, and Proxy: Reduced the size of Neon storage binaries by 50% by removing dependency debug symbols from the release build.
- Pageserver: Moved the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) redo process code from Neon's `postgres` repository to the `neon` repository and created a separate `wal_redo` binary in order to reduce the amount of change in the `postgres` repository codebase.
- Compute: Added prefetching support to improve sequential scan performance. Prefetching support is disabled by default but can be enabled by using `set enable_seqscan_prefetch = on; set seqscan_prefetch_buffers = 100;`.
- Pageserver and Safekeeper: Removed support for the `--daemonize` option from the CLI process that starts the Pageserver and Safekeeper storage components.
- Pageserver: Added a tenant sizing model and an endpoint for retrieving the tenant size.
