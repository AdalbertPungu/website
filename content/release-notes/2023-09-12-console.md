UI: Fixed an issue on the **Billing** page for Free Tier accounts that the **Estimate Pro plan cost** section of the page to be displayed incorrectly.
UI: Updated pages and modals in the console to ensure compute size default values are displayed correctly and consistently.
UI: Removed the **Postgres configuration** widget from the Neon **Dashboard**. The Postgres version used by your Neon project now appears in the **Compute** widget.
