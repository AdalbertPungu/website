### What's new

- Compute: prefetch has been released. To reduce roundtrips between compute and pageserver, this mechanic was shipped. Sequential scans will fetch numerous pages instead of traversing through them one by one.
- Safekeeper: Replaced `etcd` with custom `neon-broker`.
- Pageserver: Updated the `storage_sync` operation to make it more robust and reliable while syncing files between Pageserver and S3.
- Compute: `pg_prewarm` extension is available. Furthermore, it utilizes the above-mentioned `prefetch` feature.
- Compute: Postgres versions were updated to 14.6 and 15.1, respectively.
