### Fixes & improvements

API: Added a [Get current user](tbd) endpoint to the Neon API for retrieving information about the current user. Please be aware that this new endpoint is currently being evaluated an is subject to change.
API: Added database and role name name validation to the [Create a project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject) endpoint to prevent creation of databases and roles with protected names.
UI: The users with whom a Neon project is shared are now able to modify all project settings. The only exception is project deletion. Only a project owner can delete a project.
UI: Email addresses added when sharing a Neon project with other users are now handled in a case-insensitive manner and added to the shared list in lowercase.
UI: Fixed an issue that prevented default compute size settings that were recently configured from appearing in the **Create Compute Endpoint** modal.
UI: Adjusted the behavior of the search field on the **Branches** page to enable searching for branches with less than three characters when pressing the **Enter** key. Previously, a search could only be performed by entering a minimum of three characters.
UI: Adjusted compute type naming and labels throughout the UI for consistency.
