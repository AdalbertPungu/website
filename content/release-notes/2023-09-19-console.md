### Fixes & improvements

UI: The users with whom a Neon project is shared are now able to modify all project settings. The only exception is project deletion. Only a project owner can delete a project.
UI: Email addresses added when sharing a Neon project with other users are now handled in a case-insensitive manner and added to the shared list in lowercase.
UI: Fixed an issue that prevented default compute size settings that were recently configured from appearing in the **Create Compute Endpoint** modal.
UI: Adjusted the behavior of the search field on the **Branches** page to enable searching for branches with less than three characters when pressing **Enter**. Previously, a minimum of three characters was required.
