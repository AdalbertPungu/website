### Neon status page migration

We are excited to announce that we will be migrating the [Neon status page](https://neonstatus.com/) to a new and improved provider while retaining the same [https://neonstatus.com/](https://neonstatus.com/) domain for easy access.

#### What you need to know

1. **Migration date**: The migration is scheduled for September 14, 2023 at 08:00 UTC.
2. **Action required**:

    - **Email subscribers**: No action needed
    - **Slack subscribers**: To continue receiving real-time status updates, you will need to resubscribe to our status page on Slack. Please use the following command after migration: `/feed subscribe https://neonstatus.com/slack.rss`

3. **Same domain**: Our status page will remain accessible at the same domain ([https://neonstatus.com/](https://neonstatus.com/)). Only the underlying provider will change.
4. **No data loss**: All historical incident data and communications will be preserved during the migration.
5. **Questions or concerns**: If you have any questions or encounter any issues during or after the migration, please reach out to our support team at [support@neon.tech](mailto:support@neon.tec).

Thank you for your continued trust in our services. We look forward to providing you with an even better status page experience.
