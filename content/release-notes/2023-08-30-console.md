### Fixes & improvements

- Added a **Billing** page to the Neon Console for Neon Enterprise and Platform Partnership custom plan users. The **Billing** page is accessible from the sidebar in the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects).
- Addressed usability issues on the **Custom** tab of the **Pro Plan Cost Estimator**, accessible from the Free Tier **Billing** page in the Neon Console. Percentage values were not restored when switching between **Enter your own values** and **Use a percentage**. Additionally, minimum, maximum, and increment values were adjusted for **Compute** and **Project storage** metrics.
