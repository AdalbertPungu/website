### What's New

- Added a [guide](/docs/guides/koyeb) for using Neon with [Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com/), which is a serverless platform designed to easily deploy applications globally.
- Added [Retool](https://retool.com/) to the list of [GUI applications and clients](/docs/connect/connect-postgres-gui#tested-gui-applications-and-ides) that support connecting to Neon.
- Updated the [Connect Neon and Vercel](/docs/guides/vercel) guide to include instructions for adding the [Neon Vercel integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon) to more than one Vercel project.
- Added API request examples to the [View Operations](/docs/manage/operations) documentation, including information about polling operations status to ensure that operations are finished before issuing the next API request.
- Updated the Neon [Connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling) documentation with information about newly added support for pooled and non-pooled connection strings, which supports workflows that require both pooled and non-pooled connections.
- Added descriptions for operations properties in the [Neon API](https://neon.tech/api-reference/v2).
