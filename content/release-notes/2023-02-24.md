### What's New

- Added a [guide](/docs/guides/koyeb) for using Neon with [Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com/), which is a serverless platform designed to easily deploy applications globally.
- Added [Retool](https://retool.com/) to our list of [GUI applications and clients](/docs/connect/connect-postgres-gui#tested-gui-applications-and-ides) that support connecting to Neon.
- Updated the [Connect Neon and Vercel](/docs/guides/vercel) guide to include instructions for adding the [Neon Vercel integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon) to more than one Vercel project.
- Updated the Neon [Connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling) documentation with information about how you can enable pooling by adding a `-pooler` prefix to your connection string. This feature allows you to connect to the same database with pooled and non-pooled connections.
- Added descriptions for [Operation](https://neon.tech/api-reference/v2#/Operation) properties to the [Neon API](https://neon.tech/api-reference/v2).

### Bug Fixes:

- Fixed an issue that caused [Release notes](https://neon.tech/docs/release-notes) dates to be displayed incorrectly.
