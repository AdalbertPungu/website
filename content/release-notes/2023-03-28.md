### What's new

- Pageserver: Re-access layers before threshold eviction. To avoid re-downloading evicted files on restart, re-compute logical size and partitioning before each threshold based eviction run.
- Compute: Add local free space monitor

### Bug Fixes

Pageserver: return proper http codes in timeline delete endpoint
Pageserver: fix synthetic size for (last_record_lsn - gc_horizon) < initdb_lsn
Pageserver: eviction: avoid post-restart download by synthetic_size
