### What's new

- Added a guide for connecting Neon to PolyScale. The PolyScale service makes data-driven apps faster by simplifying global data distribution and caching. You can connect Neon to PolyScale in minutes, providing your database-backed applications with speedy access to your Neon data from anywhere in the world. For more information, see [Connect Neon to PolyScale](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/polyscale).
- Added a [Neon tutorial](https://neon.tech/docs/tutorial/neon-tutorial) that covers basic Neon concepts and features. Current tutorial topics include:
  - [Setting up a Neon project and adding data](https://neon.tech/docs/tutorial/project-setup)
  - [Recovering lost data with Neon's branching feature](https://neon.tech/docs/tutorial/data-recovery)
  - [Testing queries with Neon's branching feature](https://neon.tech/docs/tutorial/test-queries)
  Keep an eye out for new topics as we expand the tutorial to cover additional concepts and features.
- Added the ability to filter the Neon release notes by category. You can now select a category such as **Console**, **Storage**, or **Plans** to view updates for that category only.
