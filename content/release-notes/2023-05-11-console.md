### What's new

- UI: Adjusted how Autoscaling minimum and maximum compute sizes are displayed in the **Compute endpoints** table on the branch details page.
- UI: Added a **History retention** metric to the **Storage** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. By default, Neon retains a 7-day history of data changes to support [point-in-time restore](../docs/reference/glossary#point-in-time-restore). History retention will become a configurable setting in a future release.
- UI: Enhanced the **Request Downgrade** modal, which is accessible from the **Billing** page in the console.
- Control Plane: Adjusted the time interval for measuring compute utilization in Neon to avoid rounding decisions and ensure accuracy for fractional compute sizes. The minimum interval is now 12 seconds, up from 10.

### Bug fixes

- UI: Fixed modals in the console to enable form submission when the **Enter** key is pressed.
- UI: Fixed submission buttons that remained enabled after being clicked, while form data was being submitted.
