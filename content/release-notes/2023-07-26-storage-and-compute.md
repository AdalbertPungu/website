### What's new

- Compute: Neon's _Autoscaling_ feature, which automatically scales compute resources in response to workload, is now available in the US East (N. Virginia) — `aws-us-east-1` and US West (Oregon) — `aws-us-west-2` regions. _Autoscaling_ is a [Neon Pro plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) feature. To learn more, see [Autoscaling](/docs/introduction/autoscaling). For information about configuring _Autoscaling_ for your compute endpoints, see [Compute size and Autoscaling configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration).
