- Pageserver: Added support for multiple PostgreSQL versions.
- Compute: Added support for the `h3_pg` extension, which provides PostgreSQL bindings for the [H3 Core Library](https://github.com/uber/h3). For information about PostgreSQL extensions supported by Neon, see [Available PostgreSQL extensions](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/compatibility/#available-postgresql-extensions).
