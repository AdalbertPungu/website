### What's new

- Pageserver: Increased the default `compaction_period` setting to 20 seconds to reduce the frequency of polling that is performed to determine if compaction is required. The frequency of polling with the previous setting of 1 could result in excessive CPU consumption when there are numerous tenants and projects.
- Pageserver: Added initial support for online tenant relocation.
- Pageserver: Added support for multiple PostgreSQL versions.
- Compute: Added support for the `h3_pg` extension. For information about PostgreSQL extensions supported by Neon, see [Available PostgreSQL extensions](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/compatibility/#available-postgresql-extensions).
- Compute: Introduced a beta version of sequential scan page prefetch, which improves sequential scan performance.
- Compute: Tuned the backpressure algorithm, which manages the lag between the Pageserver and compute node or the Pageserver and the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) service.
- Proxy: Improved error messages and logging.
