### What's new

- The [Neon serverless driver](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless) is verified to work with the [Deno runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript](https://github.com/denoland/deno). Where would otherwise install a PostgreSQL driver, run `npm install @neondatabase/serverless` instead, then use it the same way you would use any PostgreSQL driver:

  ```js
  import { Pool } from 'npm:@neondatabase/serverless'.
  ```
