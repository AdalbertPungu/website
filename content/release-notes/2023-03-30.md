### What's new

- The [Neon serverless driver](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless) was verified to work with [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno). Where you would otherwise install a different PostgreSQL driver, simply run `npm install @neondatabase/serverless` instead, and then import the Neon serverless driver the same way you would any other driver:

  ```js
  import { Pool } from 'npm:@neondatabase/serverless'
  ```
