### What's new

- Free Tier: The _compute active time_ limit of 100 hours per month for non-primary branches now applies to all Neon Free Tier projects. For information about Free Tier limits, see [Free Tier](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/technical-preview-free-tier). The _compute active time_ limit, introduced on February 6, 2023, was not applied to projects created before that date to give users time to adjust their usage or upgrade to a [paid plan](https://neon.tech/pricing). If you have questions about this change or upgrading to a paid plan, please contact [Sales](https://neon.tech/contact-sales).
