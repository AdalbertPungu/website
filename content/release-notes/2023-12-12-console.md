### Branch reset

Neon is pleased to announce the latest branching feature to help improve your development workflows: **branch reset**.

With one click, you can now update your working branch to the latest available schema and data from its parent branch, avoiding labor-intensive and error-prone manual updates or branch restorations. This action is availble from both the Neon Console and the Neon CLI. For details, see [Reset branch from parent](/docs/manage/branches#reset-a-branch-from-parent).

### Set context for the Neon CLI

Using a new `neonctl` command, `set-context`, you can now set a background context for your CLI sessions, letting you perform project or branch-specific actions without having to specify the project or branch id in every command. See [Neon CLI commands â€” set-context](docs/reference/cli-set-context) for more detail.

### Support for timescaledb 2.13.0 for Postgres 16

The `timescaledb` extension, version 2.13.0, which enables scalable inserts and complex queries for time-series data, is now available on Postgres 16.

| Postgres extension           | Old version   | New version   |
|------------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| `timescaledb`                 |2.10.1        | 2.13.0        |

Older versions remain on Postgres 15 or 14.

If you installed this extension previously and want to upgrade to the latest version, please refer to [Update an extension version](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions#update-an-extension-version) for instructions.
