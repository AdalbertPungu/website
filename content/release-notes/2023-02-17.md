### What's new

- Control Plane: Increased maximum number of connections in the connection pooler to `10000`.
- Control Plane: Added internal retry mechanism, when handling proxy connections. This should increase success rate of the connection attempts using proxy.
- UI: Improve Content Security Policy headers.

### Bug fixes

- API: [List projects API endpoint](https://neon.tech/api-reference/v2#/Project/listProjects) OpenAPI spec now shows actual default (`10`) and maximum (`100`) pagination parameters, which were previously only enforced on the backend side.
- API: Fixed `default_endpoint_settings` resetting after project name update.
- Control Plane: Fixed bug that caused reordering of the operations execution.
