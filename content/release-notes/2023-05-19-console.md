### What's new

Control Plane: Neon's Autoscaling feature now supports fractional (1/4 and 1/2) minimum compute sizes. Previously, the the minimum compute size limit for Autoscaling was 1.

API: Added an an experimental `synthetic_storage_size` property to the Projects API, which provides the Neon data storage size in bytes. The value represents  the logical data size plus the amount of Write-Ahead Log (WAL) data stored by Neon.
