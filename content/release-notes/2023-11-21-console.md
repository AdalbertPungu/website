### Fixes & improvements

- Control Plane: Raised the PgBouncer `default_pool_size` limit, which defines the number of server connections allowed per user/database pair, from 16 to 64 to avoid running out of available server connections.
- Integrations: Fixed an issue that permitted using a Neon project without a compute endpoint when adding the [Neon Vercel Integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon). 
- UI: Updated the Prisma code snippet in the **Connection Details** widget. The revised code no longer includes the `connection_timeout` parameter or `shadowDatabaseUrl` variable. These are no longer required due to reduced Neon cold start times and support for database creation via SQL.
- UI: Added an external link icon to the code snippet text box on the **Connection Details** widget to enable easy access to related documentation.
