### Neon serverless driver enhancements

The [Neon serverless driver](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless) is a low-latency Postgres driver for JavaScript and TypeScript that allows you to query data from serverless and edge environments over HTTP or WebSockets in place of TCP.

The driver now supports larger response sizes and batched queries over HTTP.

#### Larger response size for queries over HTTP

The maximum response size for queries over HTTP was raised from 1 MB to 10 MB.

#### Support for batched queries over HTTP

You can now issue multiple queries at once in a single, non-interactive transaction using the `transaction()` function, which is exposed as property of the query function. For example:

```js
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
const showLatestN = 10;

const [posts, tags] = await sql.transaction([
  sql`SELECT * FROM posts ORDER BY posted_at DESC LIMIT ${showLatestN}`,
  sql`SELECT * FROM tags`,
]);
```

The `transaction()` function supports the same return format keys as the ordinary query function -- `arrayMode`, `fullResults`, and `fetchOptions` â€” plus three additional keys concerning transaction configuration:

- `isolationMode`

  Selects a Postgres transaction isolation mode. If present, it must be one of: `ReadUncommitted`, `ReadCommitted`, `RepeatableRead` or `Serializable`.

- `readOnly`
  
  Ensures that a `READ ONLY` transaction is used to execute the queries passed.

- `deferrable`

  If true (and if `readOnly` is also true, and isolationMode is `Serializable`), this option ensures that a `DEFERRABLE` transaction is used to execute the queries passed.
