### What's new

- A **Pro Plan Cost Estimation** tool has been introduced for Free Tier users. This tool, which calculates an estimate of the Pro Plan costs based on your current project usage, can help answer the question, "What would be my monthly cost to date if I upgraded to the [Neon Pro plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan)?" To use this tool, navigate to the **Billing** page from the sidebar of the Neon Console and select **Estimate costs**.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue that caused the date to be displayed in the **Time** field on the **Branch** details page after creating a branch from `main` using the **Time** option.
