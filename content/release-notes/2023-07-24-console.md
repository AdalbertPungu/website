### What's new

- Added an **Auto-suspend delay** control to the project creation dialog, enabling Neon Pro plan users to define a default **Auto-suspend delay** setting for a project's compute endpoints. The **Auto-suspend delay** setting defines the period of inactivity after which a compute endpoint is automatically suspended. For more information, see [Create a project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).
- Updated the **Usage** widget on the Neon Dashboard for Free Tier accounts to provide additional details about the _Active time_ usage metric.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed OAuth page styling and other minor style issues for the Neon Console dark mode theme.
