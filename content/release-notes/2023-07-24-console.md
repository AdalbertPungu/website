### What's new

- Added an **Auto-suspend delay** control to the project creation dialog, enabling Neon Pro plan users to define a default **Auto-suspend delay** setting for a project's compute endpoints when creating a project. The **Auto-suspend delay** setting defines the period of inactivity after which a compute endpoint is automatically suspended. All compute endpoints created in the project are created with the defined setting. For more information, see [Create a project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).

### Bug fixes

- Fixed OAuth page styling in dark mode. Page text was not fully visible with a dark background.
