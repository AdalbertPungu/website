Finding stuff with Quicklinks has become even faster now. Just select text in any app and press the hotkey for a Quicklink to search the selected text with that Quicklink. This was inspired by the Quick Search extension built by @iwfan and you can find details on how to enable it here.

We're super thrilled to announce our Store and API to build, share and discover extensions. This lets you tailor Raycast to your needs. During the beta phase, our community has already built more than 100 extensions that you can search and install via the new built-in Store command.
