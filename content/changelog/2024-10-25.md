<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Contact support form improvements**:

    - PNG (. png)
    - JPEG (. jpeg)
    - GIF (. gif)
    - Text (. txt)

- **SQL Editor AI features are now open to everyone**:

- **Neon Console enhancements**:
  - Added a **Settings** option to the Account navigation sidebar in the Neon Console, providing easier access to personal and Organization account settings.

- **Neon API change**:
  - Added `state_changed_at` field for branches. When getting branch details, the response now returns a state_changed_at field, showing the timestamp (UTC) when the branch's `current_state` first started.
  - Updated the [Create Project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject) API to return a 404 error instead of a 500 error when an invalid region is specified.
  - Updated the `project_id` field for the [Get consumption metrics for each project](https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/consumption_history/projects) API. You can now specify project IDs as a comma-separated list in addition to an array of parameter values. This provides more flexibility when filtering responses by project. If omitted, the response will include all projects.
    - As an array: `project_ids=cold-poetry-09157238&project_ids=quiet-snow-71788278`
    - As a comma-separated list: `project_ids=cold-poetry-09157238,quiet-snow-71788278`


- **More local disk space on for Neon computes**:
  We increased the local disk space allocation for Neon computes, which will now receive 15 GiB x maximum vCPU settings with a minimum of 20 GiB. This change ensures optimal handling of temporary data, query operations, and maintenance tasks in Postgres.
