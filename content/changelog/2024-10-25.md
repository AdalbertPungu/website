### Neon SQL Editor AI feature are now open to everyone

[Join our Early Access Program](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/early-access) to try out the AI features we're testing in the Neon SQL Editor.

Explore three AI-driven features:

- **SQL generation**: Convert natural language requests to SQL with ease. Press the ✨ button or use **Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+M**, type your request, and the AI assistant will generate the corresponding SQL. It’s schema-aware, so you can reference table names, functions, and other objects in your schema.
  ![SQL generation](/docs/get-started-with-neon/sql_editor_ai.png)
- **Fix with AI**: When your query returns an error, click **Fix with AI** next to the error message. The AI assistant will analyze the issue, suggest a fix, and update the SQL Editor so you can run the query again.

- **AI-generated query names**: Queries in the Neon SQL Editor's **History** are automatically assigned descriptive names. This feature helps you quickly identify and reuse previous queries.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Contact support form improvements**:

  You can now attach files along with your problem description when requesting help from Neon support. File size limit is 50 MB and we support the following file types:
    - PDF (. pdf)
    - PNG (. png)
    - JPEG (. jpeg)
    - GIF (. gif)
    - Text (. txt)

- **Neon Console enhancements**:
  Added a **Settings** option to the Account navigation sidebar in the Neon Console, providing easier access to personal and Organization account settings.
  ![Account settings](/docs/relnotes/account_settings.png)

- **Neon API changes**:
  - Added `state_changed_at` field for branches. When getting branch details, the response now returns a `state_changed_at` field, showing the timestamp (UTC) when the branch's `current_state` first started.
  - Updated the [Create Project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject) API to return a 404 error instead of a 500 error when an invalid region is specified.
  - Updated the `project_id` field for the [Get consumption metrics for each project](https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/consumption_history/projects) API. You can now specify project IDs as a comma-separated list in addition to an array of parameter values. This provides more flexibility when filtering responses by project. If omitted, the response will include all projects.
    - As an array: `project_ids=cold-poetry-09157238&project_ids=quiet-snow-71788278`
    - As a comma-separated list: `project_ids=cold-poetry-09157238,quiet-snow-71788278`

- **More local disk space on for Neon computes**:
  We increased the local disk space allocation for Neon computes, which will now receive 15 GiB x maximum vCPU settings with a minimum of 20 GiB. This change ensures optimal handling of temporary data, query operations, and maintenance tasks in Postgres.
