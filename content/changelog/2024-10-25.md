### Neon SQL Editor AI features are now open to everyone

Three AI-driven features are now available to everyone in the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor).

- **SQL generation**: Convert natural language requests to SQL with ease. Press the ✨ button or use **Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+M**, type your request, and the AI assistant will generate the corresponding SQL. It’s schema-aware, so you can reference table names, functions, and other objects in your schema.

- **Fix with AI**: When your query returns an error, click **Fix with AI** next to the error message. The AI assistant will analyze the issue, suggest a fix, and update the SQL Editor so you can run the query again.

- **AI-generated query names**: Queries in the Neon SQL Editor's **History** are automatically assigned descriptive names. This feature helps you quickly identify and reuse previous queries.

### Improved conversion from User to Organization accounts

We’ve introduced an improved process to help existing customers who want to convert their personal Neon accounts to organization accounts. Previously, this process required setting up a new organization, transferring projects, and entering billing details again. You can now convert your User account to an Organization with a single action. This will transfer all of your projects and billing to the new organization instantly, with no service disruption and no changes to your connections. Your personal account will automatically switch to the Free Plan after conversion.

For more details on how to convert your account, see [Convert your personal account](/docs/manage/organizations#convert-your-personal-account).

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console enhancement**

  We added a **Settings** option to the Account navigation sidebar in the Neon Console for easier access to personal and Organization account settings.
  ![Account settings](/docs/relnotes/account_settings.png)

- **Neon API changes**

  - Updated the [Create Project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject) API to return a 404 error instead of a 500 error when an invalid region is specified.
  - Updated the `project_id` field for the [Get consumption metrics for each project](https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/consumption_history/projects) API. You can now specify project IDs as a comma-separated list in addition to an array of parameter values. This provides more flexibility when filtering responses by project. If omitted, the response will include all projects.
    - As an array: `project_ids=cold-poetry-09157238&project_ids=quiet-snow-71788278`
    - As a comma-separated list: `project_ids=cold-poetry-09157238,quiet-snow-71788278`

- **More local disk space for Neon computes**

  We increased the local disk space allocation for Neon computes, which will now receive 15 GiB x maximum vCPU setting with a minimum of 20 GiB. This change ensures optimal handling of temporary data, query operations, and maintenance tasks in Postgres.

- **Fixes**

  - Addressed an issue with the Neon Vercel Integration where the `PGPASSWORD` variable in Vercel was not longer accepted after enabling branch protection on the main branch. Branch protection resulted in new passwords being generated for Postgres roles on child branches. To prevent this issue, a `PGPASSWORD` variable is now set for each new preview branch.
