### Fixes & improvements

- The [neon_superuser](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role) role is now able to execute the `pg_stat_statements_reset()` function that is part of the `pg_stat_statements` extension. This function discards statistics gathered so far by `pg_stat_statements`. Roles created in the Neon console, CLI, or API, including the default role created with each Neon project, are granted membership in the `neon_superuser` role.
- Fixed the **Cancel** action in card drawers on the **Integrations** page in the Neon Console. When clicking **Cancel**, card drawers did not close.
- Added a **Vercel integration** card to the **Integrations** page in the Neon Console.

### Docs

- Add a new logical repliocation guide for replicating data from Neon with Fivetran. See [Replicate data with Fivetran](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/logical-replication-fivetran).
