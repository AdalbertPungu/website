  |-----------|-------------|-------------|
  | unit      | 7.7         | 7.9         |
  | pgjwt     | 7.x         | 7.?         |

- **Neon API change**:

- **Postgres 17 wait events system view**: Added custom wait events to the Neon extension, as exposed in the [pg_wait_events](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-wait-events.html) system view introduced in Postgres 17. Backends that are waiting in Neon's storage system will now report what component of the system they're waiting for specifically, rather than just showing up as "Extension".

- **Fixes**:
