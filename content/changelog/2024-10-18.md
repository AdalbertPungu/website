### New monitoring graphs

We're continuing to improve visibility into your database performance with two new graphs on the **Monitoring** page: [LFC hit rate](/docs/introduction/monitoring-page#local-file-cache-hit-rate) and [Working set size](/docs/introduction/monitoring-page#working-set-size).

<div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>
  <div style={{ flex: 1, paddingRight: '20px' }}>

  <div style={{ flex: 1 }}>

  </div>

The **Local file cache hit rate** graph shows the percentage of read requests served from memory. A high hit rate indicates better performance, as more data is served from cache (faster) instead of being pulled from storage (slower). See [What is the Local File Cache](/docs/extensions/neon#what-is-the-local-file-cache) for more info.

The **Working set size** graph tracks the amount of data your database accesses over time. For best performance, your working set should fit within the LFC, minimizing slower queries that pull data from storage. See [Working set size](/docs/introduction/monitoring-page#working-set-size) for details.

### New banner for custom date range selection

Along with the new graphs on the **Monitoring** page, we also now added a banner to show your custom date range selection, making it a bit easier to keep track of your selected time frame when analyzing performance metrics.

### Delete your restore backup branches!

When working with branches, we recommend deleting old and unused branches where possible. This helps free up disk space and keep your project organized. Now, we’ve made that easier: you can delete backup branches created by restore operations on your project’s root branch (typically named main).

For more details, and other recommendations, see [Deleting backup branches](/docs/guides/branch-restore#deleting-backup-branches)

- **Postgres extension updates**:

  Added support for the following extensions to Postgres 17.

  | Extension        | Version |
  | ---------------- | ------- |
  | PostGIS          | 3.5.0   |
  | pgrouting        | 3.6.2   |
  | h3               | 4.1.3   |
  | unit             | 7.9     |
  | pgjwt            | f3d82fd |
  | pg_hashids       | 1.2.1   |
  | ip4r             | 2.4.2   |
  | prefix           | 1.2.10  |
  | postgresql-hll   | 2.18    |
  | pg_roaringbitmap | 0.5.4   |
  | pg-semver        | 0.40.0  |

Updated support of extensions for Postgres versions 14 through 16:

| Extension | Old Version | New Version |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| unit      | 7.7         | 7.9         |
| pgjwt     | 7.x         | 7.?         |

- **Neon API change**:
  - Removed the deprecated `/consumption/projects` endpoint entirely from the API.

- **Postgres 17 wait events system view**: Added custom wait events to the Neon extension, as exposed in the [pg_wait_events](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-wait-events.html) system view introduced in Postgres 17. Backends that are waiting in Neon's storage system will now report what component of the system they're waiting for specifically, rather than just showing up as "Extension".

- **Fixes**:
  - Fixed an issue where Free Plan users were sometimes unable to select a paid plan after their previous selection failed to register.
  - Fixed a problem with the Support form that became unresponsive when switching between Organizations.
