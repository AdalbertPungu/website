### Fixes & improvements

- Added several new cards to the **Request** section of **Integrations** page in the Neon Console where you can express your interest and share your feedback about future integrations with Neon. Your input helps the Neon team design and prioritize integrations. To learn how to participate, see [Express interest in upcoming integrations](/docs/manage/integrations#express-interest-in-upcoming-integrations).
- Added a dialog requiring user confirmation when removing all IP addresses from an IP Allow configuration.
