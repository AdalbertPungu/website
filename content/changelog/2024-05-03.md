### New Consumption API for accounts

To help Scale plan users get granular consumption metrics for your account as a whole for individual projects, we've added two new endpoints dedicated to the task:

- [Get account consumption metrics](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getconsumptionhistoryperaccount)
- [Get consumption metrics for each project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getconsumptionhistoryperproject)

Metrics are available starting **March 1st, 2024** for existing Scale plan users. You'll need to specify **from** and **to** timestamp parameters that match the selected level of granularity: hourly, daily, or monthly.

### Improved navigation for Project pages

We've improved how you move between the different pages in the Neon Console.

- The sidebar navigation is re-ordered to help you switch between pages more intuitively.
- We moved **Operations** from a dedicated page to a tab on the **Monitoring** page called **System operations**.

    Notice that the **Compute** column is now made up of clickable links, letting you open the side drawer to edit any endpoint's compute settings from this view.

    Expect to see more observability-related tabs appear on the **Monitoring** page in upcoming releases.

### Fixes & improvements

- We've made it easier for you to properly copy connection strings from the Neon Console. For safety, your password is not revealed directly in the browser but is replaced with `****`. When you manually copy the connection string from the text window, the actual password is now included in the clipboard. Previously, copying the connection string directly from the window included the obscured password instead of the actual one. 

    Using the dedicated **Copy** button continues to work as expected: perfectly!

- An issue with the SQL Editor compute endpoint selector has been fixed. The selected endpoint is now correctly used for all of your queries.
- When you encounter a project error, you now properly see an error screen. Previously, you were sometimes redirected to the Projects page without adequate explanation.
- We fixed an issue where setting the history retention for a Neon project to 0 and removing data did not reduce the projectâ€™s storage size as expected. Previously, there was a 64 MiB data change threshold that had to be met before retained history was removed.
- Database name validation was added to the Neon CLI `connection-string` command to ensure that the correct database name is used in a generated connection string. This improvement resolves an issue with the [neondatabase/create-branch-action](https://github.com/neondatabase/create-branch-action) GitHub Action, which uses the `connection-string` command to set the `db_url` for a newly created branch.
