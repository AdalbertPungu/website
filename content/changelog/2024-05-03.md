### Drizzle Studio in the Neon Console

We've integrated Drizzle Studio into the Neon Console, which lets you browse, add, update, and delete records from directly within the Neon Console. The Drizzle Studio integration also supports downloading data in `.json` and `.csv` file formats. You can access the Drizzle Studio integration from sidebar in the Neon console.

- For your convenience, we moved **Operations** from a dedicated page in the Neon Console to a new tab on the **Monitoring** page. You can expect to see more observability-related tabs appear on the **Monitoring** page in upcoming releases.
