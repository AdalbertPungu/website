description: The next act for the Neon platform
---
The Neon Product Team spent this week mapping the future state of our platform, focused on shipping faster with Postgres, and what it takes to get there.

We're excited about the big changes coming. While we want to keep some surprises under wraps, we'd like to share a few details here to let you know what to expect, and get any feedback you'd like to share:

- **Full-stack developer workflows** &#8212; We're building end-to-end developer workflows focused on your database needs. Things like data and schema migrations, data anonymization and related features to support staging environments, CI/CD integrations and more. If you have ideas on what you'd like to see in a full-stack workflow, [let us know on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/92vNTzKDGp).
- **Integrated developer applications** &#8212; We're making plans to solve other hard problems in App DevX, which we'll share when the time is right. Stay tuned.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Did you know?">
Neon supports passwordless connections via `psql`. Instead of supplying a connection string when connecting with `psql`, you can simply type `psql -h pg.neon.tech` to authenticate through a browser-based authentication flow.
