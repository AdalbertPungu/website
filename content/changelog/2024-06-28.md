This week, the Neon Product Engineering Team gathered for an intensive offsite meeting to map out what we'll build next to help our users **ship faster with Postgres**.

We're thrilled to announce that significant updates are on the horizon. While we’ll keep some of the details under wraps for now, we’d like to share a few highlights.

**Full-stack Developer workflows**

- Full stack workflows with data and schema migrations
- Support for data anonymization and staging environments
- Integrated infrastructure features touching on areas including private connectivity, observability, and backup automationß

**Solving the Hard Problems in App DevX**

- SimplifyingaAuthentication
- Easily-integrated payment solutions 
- Storage solutions for images and files

**AI integration**










<Admonition type="tip" title="Did you know?">
Neon supports passwordless connections via `psql`. Instead of supplying a connection string when connecting with `psql`, you can simply type `psql -h pg.neon.tech` to authenticate through a browser-based authentication flow.
