### Anonymize sensitive data with Neon and Neosync

We are excited to announce that Neon has partnered with [Neosync](https://www.neosync.dev/) to provide developers with a complete solution for branching Postgres databases with anonymized data. Neosync is an open-source platform that helps developers anonymize production data and sync it across their environments for a better developer experience.

Both Neon and Neosync offer generous free tiers. If youâ€™re interested in trying it out, follow the steps in our [Neosync guide](/docs/guides/neosync-anonymize) to get started.

### Join the Neon Early Access Program from the Console

You can now join the **Neon Early Access Program** directly from the Neon Console to be among the first to try new Neon features. From your **Profile** menu, select **Account Settings** > **Early Access**, and submit your Discord username.

The benefits of joining include:

- **Exclusive early access**: Get a first look at upcoming features before they go live.
- **Private community**: Gain access to a dedicated Discord channel to connect with the Neon team and provide feedback to help shape what comes next.
- **Weekly insights**: Receive updates on Neon's latest developments and future plans.

### Computes, databases, and roles moved to branch pages in the Neon Console

Computes, roles, and databases are now accessed from individual branch pages in the Neon Console instead of the Neon Console sidebar. Each of those objects is associated with a particular branch in a Neon project, and this change is intended to reflect that relationship.

With this change, the compute endpoint delete option was moved to the **Edit compute endpoint** drawer, accessed by clicking **Edit** on the **Computes** tab.

For more information about how objects in a Neon project are organized and related, see [Overview of the Neon object hierarchy](/docs/manage/overview).

### Fixes & improvements


- Improved the text on the **Billing** page in the Neon Console to better explain compute usage and allowances for each of Neon's plans.
- Added a **Home** button to the Neon login page to provide a means of navigating to the Neon website if that was the intended destination.
- Updated the Drizzle Studio version that supports the **Tables** page in the Neon Console. The new version fixes a display issue for long `BIGINT` values.
- Improved the design of **Billing summary** section on the **Billing** page in the Neon Console to make it easier to understand your current billing status.
- Addressed an issue with the [Neon Vercel Integration](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/vercel) that prevented the [automatic branch deletion](/docs/guides/vercel#automatic-deletion) feature from removing Neon branches after merging the corresponding Git branch.
- [05/30] Adjusted the functioning of the **Create support ticket** modal in the Neon Console to avoid automatically selecting **Branch** and **Compute** field values when opening the modal.
- [05/30] The **Database size** chart on the **Monitoring** page in the Neon Console now displays size information for up to 10 databases.
- [05/30] Fixed an issue that prevented the **Autosuspend delay** option from being displayed on the **Edit compute endpoint** drawer in shared projects. 
- [05/30] Scale plan users can now view database metrics for the past 14 days on the **Monitoring** page in the Neon Console. To try it out, go to the **Monitoring** page and select the **Last 14 days** item from the **Other** menu. Previously, metrics could only be viewed for the past 7 days.
