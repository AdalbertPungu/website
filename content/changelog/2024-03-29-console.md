### PostgreSQL Partition Manager extension

We added support for the [pg_partman](https://github.com/pgpartman/pg_partman) Postgres extension, which lets you create and manage time-based and number-based table partition sets.

### Neon Vercel integration enhancements

- Added a drop-down menu to the **Branches** tab in the **Vercel integration** drawer. From the drop-down menu, you can delete all preview branches or only those marked as `Obsolete`. Obsolete branches are those that no longer have an associated git branch. Removing old or obsolete branches regularly helps avoid using up your storage allowance or hitting branch limits. For more information, see [Manage branches created by the integration](/docs/guides/vercel#manage-branches-created-by-the-integration).
- The Neon Vercel integration now supports automatic deletion of obsolete Neon branches. This feature can be enabled when installing the integration by selecting the **Automatically delete obsolete Neon branches** option. This option is enabled by default when installing the integration. This feature is not enabled for existing integration installations. Automatic branch deletion occurs when the git branch that triggered the branch's creation is deleted.
- A branch creation date is now displayed for each preview branch listed on the **Branches** tab in the Vercel integration drawer.

### Local File Cache (LFC) statistics and working set size function

You can now view Local File Cache (LFC) statistics for your Neon compute. The statistics include a cache hit ratio, which can help you determine if your data is being accessed from memory or the Neon storage layer.
The Local File Cache (LFC) is a layer of caching that stores frequently accessed data in the local memory of your Neon compute instance. The cache helps to reduce latency and improve query performance by minimizing the need to fetch data from the Neon storage layer. The LFC acts as an add-on or extension of Postgres [shared buffers](#shared-buffers). In Neon, the `shared_buffers` setting is always 128 MB, regardless of compute size. The LFC extends cache memory up to 80% of your compute's RAM.
Local File Cache (LFC) statistics are exposed through a `neon_stat_file_cache view`, which you access by installing the `neon` extension.
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION neon;
```
You can run the following query to view statistics:
```sql
SELECT * FROM neon.neon_stat_file_cache;
 file_cache_misses | file_cache_hits | file_cache_used | file_cache_writes | file_cache_hit_ratio
-------------------+-----------------+-----------------+-------------------+----------------------
           2133643 |       108999742 |             607 |          10767410 |                98.08
```
You can also use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` with the `FILECACHE` option to view LFC cache hit and miss data.
Additionally, the `neon` extension now provides an `approximate_working_set_size()` function that can be used to estimate your working set size. Ideally, your working set should fit in your compute's memory.
For more information, see [The neon extension](https://neon.tech/docs/extensions/neon). To learn how the LFC cache hit ratio and `approximate_working_set_size()` function can help you right-size your compute, see [How to size your compute](/docs/manage/endpoints#how-to-size-your-compute).

### Fixes & improvements

- Corrected an issue that prevented a Free Tier user from creating a new read-write compute for their primary branch after deleting the one created with their Neon project. 
- Updated the visual displayed on the Projects page in the Neon Console when all projects are removed.
- Fixed a number of UI copy inconsistencies in the Neon Console.
- Adjusted copy and links on the connection details modal that is displayed after creating a new project.

### Stashed items

### Drizzle Studio Integration into Neon Console
We've integrated Drizzle Studio into the Neon Console, which lets you browse, add, update, and delete records from directly within the Neon Console. The Drizzle Studio integration also supports downloading data in `.json` and `.csv` file formats. You can access the Drizzle Studio integration from sidebar in the Neon console.

### Neon Serverless driver JavaScript Registry (JSR) package

The Neon serverless driver is now available as a [JavaScript Registry (JSR)](https://jsr.io/docs/introduction) package: [https://jsr.io/@neon/serverless](https://jsr.io/@neon/serverless). The JavaScript Registry (JSR) is a package registry for JavaScript and TypeScript. JSR works with many runtimes (Node.js, Deno, browsers, and more) and is backward compatible with `npm`.
