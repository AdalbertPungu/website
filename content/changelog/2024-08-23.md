![Neon logical replication banner](/docs/relnotes/neon-logical-replication.jpg)

Neon is pleased to announce **GA support** for replicating data from Neon to other data services and platforms for for Change Data Capture (CDC) setups.

- The Billing page for Free Plan users now shows a percentage value for **Compute branches** usage. The title of this metric was also changed from **Compute** to **Compute branches** to reflect that the compute allowance tracked by this metric is for non-primary branch computes.

- Queries saved to the Neon SQL Editor **Saved** list are now limited to 9 KB in length. A similar restriction was introduced Neon SQL Editor **History** list last week. While you can execute longer queries from the SQL Editor, any query exceeding 9 KB will be truncated when saved. A `-- QUERY TRUNCATED` comment is added at the beginning of these queries to indicate truncation.
- We updated the Drizzle Studio version that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console. This update addresses an issue where updating a column value in one row via the table editor the same column value in in other rows to be updated.
- Fixed an issue in the Neon Console where some page labels in the sidebar were not highlighted when selected.
