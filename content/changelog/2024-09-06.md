<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- When you perform a [branch reset or restore](/docs/introduction/point-in-time-restore) operation on a child branch, the role passwords on the child branch are now preserved. Previously, resetting or restoring a child branch (where passwords were previously regenerated) resets the passwords back to those used on the parent branch. The protected branches feature is available with the Neon [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans#scale) plan. To learn more, refer to our [Protected Branches guide](/docs/guides/protected-branches).
- [FF] We now support self-serve account deletion should you need to remove your Neon account for any reason. See [Delete your account](/docs/manage/accounts#delete-your-account) for details.
- [FF] We added two new charts to the **Monitoring** page in the Neon Console for monitoring Read Replica replication lag. These charts are visible when selecting a **Replica** compute from the **Compute** drop-down menu.
  - **Replication delay bytes**: Measures the total size, in bytes, of the data that has been sent from the primary compute but has not yet been applied on the replica. A larger value indicates a higher backlog of data waiting to be replicated, which may suggest issues with replication throughput or resource availability on the replica.
  - **Replication delay seconds**: Indicates the time delay, in seconds, between the last transaction committed on the primary compute and the application of that transaction on the replica. A higher value suggests that the replica is behind the primary, potentially due to network latency, high replication load, or resource constraints on the replica.
- [FF] As an additional branch protection measure, we've implemented automatic Postgres role password reset for branches created from protected branches. When you create a child branch, roles that exist on the parent are copied to the child branch, including their passwords. If the parent branch is defined as protected, the passwords for those roles on the child branch are now automatically reset to a new generated value. This prevents passwords defined on your protected branch, which might be a production branch, from being exposed on a child branch. Protected branches are Scale plan feature.
- [FF] You can now request a refund for any invoice directly from the **Billing** page in the Neon Console. To do this, simply select **Request refund** from the invoice menu, provide a brief description of the billing issue, and click **Request refund**. The Neon billing team will review your request promptly.
