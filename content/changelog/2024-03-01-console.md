### Local File Cache (LFC) statistics

Neon extends Postgres shared buffers with a Local File Cache (LFC), which is a layer of caching that stores frequently accessed data from the storage layer in the local memory of a Neon compute instance. Like shared buffers, the LFC helps to reduce latency and improve query performance by minimizing the need to fetch data from the storage layer repeatedly.

We have also added the folliowing LFC statistics to `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output:

- `File cache: hits`
- `File cache: misses`

### Fixes & improvements

- Added Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) to the Neon Proxy, enabling the serverless driver to prefer HTTP/2 connections. HTTP/2 allows for better connection reuse and can reduce edge latency for high-concurrency workflows.
- Improved error messaging for connection failures when IP Allow is enabled and the IP address of the connecting client is not on the IP allowlist.
- The [neon_superuser](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role) now has full privileges on tables and sequences created in the `public` schema and can grant those privileges to other roles. This change ensures that tables and sequences created by the Postgres superuser during extension installation are fully accessible to a `neon_superuser`.
- A connection dropped from the **SQL Editor** while running a query now cancels the query process in Postgres. Previously, the query process would be left running.
