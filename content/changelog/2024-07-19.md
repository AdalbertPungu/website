### Larger compute sizes

We've added support for larger compute sizes. Noen Scale plan users can now scale computes up to 10 vCPU with 40 GB of RAM.

### Hackable AI start apps

We've published a brand new set of hackable, pre-built [AI starter apps](https://neon.tech/docs/ai/ai-intro#ai-starter-apps) to help you get up and running with Postgres as your vector store. The set includes a variety of AI application types, including:

- AI chat
- RAG chat
- Semantic search
- Hybrid search
- Reverse image search
- Chat with PDF

Clone an app and make it your own.

For more, check out our new [Neon AI Starter Kit](/docs/ai/ai-intro), where you'll find links to the start app code, our AI docs, and a collection of AI applications built with Neon for reference and inspiration.

Consider sharing your AI app on our **#showcase** channel on Discord. We'd love to see what you're building.
