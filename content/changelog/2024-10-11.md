### More projects on the Free Plan

Our Free plan users told us they needed more projects: we've expanded the project limits from 1 to 10.

### New monitoring graphs

We're committed to improving observability into what's happening with your databases and the computes that power them. The latest addition: [LFC hit rate](/docs/introduction/monitoring-page#local-file-cache-hit-rate) and [Working set size](/docs/introduction/monitoring-page#working-set-size) graphs.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- The [Delete Project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/deleteproject) API now returns a 404 Not Found response instead of a 200 OK response if the project has already been deleted. This is a potentially breaking change for applications that expect a 200 OK response for all delete operations, regardless of whether a project was actually deleted.
- We've released a new version of the Neon CLI, with the followign updates:
  - Removed the deprecated `set-primary` branch command
  - Removed the deprecated `--allow-list` and `--ip-primary-only` flags from the `project update` command
  - Removed the deprecated `--primary-only` flag from the `ip-allow` command
  - Added empty state messages for the `project list` command
