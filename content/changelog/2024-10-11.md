### 10 Projects on the Free Plan

We're excited to announce that Neon Free Plan users can now create up to 10 projects. We hope this increase will make it easier for you to learn a new stack, launch an AI-powered IDE, ship an MVP, upgrade to the next version of Postgres, or anything else the previous project limit might have kept you from doing. Why did we make this change? Read all about it here: [10x-ing our Free Plan: Everyone Gets Ten Projects](https://neon.tech/blog/10x-projects-on-free-plan).

Please note that Free Plan account-level limits on compute hours, storage, and bandwidth remain unchanged.

### New monitoring graphs

We're committed to improving observability into what's happening with your databases and the computes that power them. The latest addition: [LFC hit rate](/docs/introduction/monitoring-page#local-file-cache-hit-rate) and [Working set size](/docs/introduction/monitoring-page#working-set-size) graphs.

### Drag-to-zoom monitoring graphs

We've enhanced the graphs on our **Monitoring** page to support drag-to-zoom. Just click and drag to zoom in on the selected range.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- The [Delete Project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/deleteproject) API now returns a 404 Not Found response instead of a 200 OK response if the project has already been deleted. This is a potentially breaking change for applications that expect a 200 OK response for all delete operations, regardless of whether a project was actually deleted.
- We've released a new version of the Neon CLI, with the followign updates:
  - Removed the deprecated `set-primary` branch command
  - Removed the deprecated `--allow-list` and `--ip-primary-only` flags from the `project update` command
  - Removed the deprecated `--primary-only` flag from the `ip-allow` command
  - Added empty state messages for the `project list` command
- We updated the **Create support ticket** modal in the Neon Console to include a drop-down menu for selecting a personal account or organization.
- Fixed a lag issue with the **Create support ticket** modal.
- Enabled selecting a shared project in the **Create support ticket** modal account selector.
- Fixed an issue that prevented deleting a branch with a ephemeral compute endpoint that was created for performing a schema diff.
- Fixed an issue with the GitHub integration that prevented information in the integration drawer from being updated after performing an action in the drawer.
- Fixed an issue in the GitHub integration that permitted connecting to the same GitHub repository from different Neon projects, which would overwrite previously configured variables.
- When a collaborator is added as a member of an organization, that user is now removed as a collaborator from projects in the organization. Otherwise, the user would be both a collaborator and a member, which is redundant.
- To help resolve support cases faster, the consent option in the **Create support ticket** modal to allow Neon Support staff to connect to your database is now selected by default. You can leave this option selected or deselect it when opening a support ticket.
- The table on the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console now includes an **Integrations** column that lists your project's integrations. If you don't have any an **Add** option takes you to the **Integrations** page where you can view available integrations.
- Upgraded the `neon` extension to version 1.5 for all Postgres versions.
- Added support for the new [pg_wait_events](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-wait-events.html) system view that reports wait event types that was introduced in Postgres 17, which is useful for adding descriptions to wait events reported in `pg_stat_activity`.
