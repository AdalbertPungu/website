### Neon Vercel Integration enhancements

The Vercel integration drawer in the Neon console now supports viewing and deleting preview deployment branches and defining a default database and role for new preview deployment branches.

### Fixes & improvements

- You can now view the sign-in methods configured for your Neon account from the **Profile** page under **Account Settings**. The **Profile** page also supports unlinking social accounts such as Google or GitHub from your Neon account.
- Fixed an issue that prevented a Scale plan user from submitting a support ticket from the **Create Support Ticket** form in the Neon Console.
- When creating a project, the default Postgres role created with your project is now named for the database using the following naming scheme: `dbname_owner`, where _dbname_ is the name of the database. This change reflects that the default Postgres role is the owner of the initial database that is created with the project.
- Added alert messages that appear in the **Usage** section on the **Billing** page when approaching or exceeding your plan allowances. For information about Neon plans and allowances, see [How billing works](/docs/introduction/how-billing-works).
- Added a confirmation dialog showing the selected plan and payment method when a user selects **Upgrade to Launch plan** or **Upgrade to Scale plan** on the **Billing** page in the Neon Console.
- Updated PgBouncer to [version 1.22.1](https://www.pgbouncer.org/2024/03/pgbouncer-1-22-1). Neon uses PgBouncer to provide support for [connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling).
- Removed a redundant **Close** button from the **Edit compute endpoint** drawer on the Free Tier.
- Fixed an issue that caused project creation limits to be ignored when creating a new project before the previous project creation operation was finished.
- Fixed an issue that incorrectly permitted A Neon account to share a project with the owner of the project.
