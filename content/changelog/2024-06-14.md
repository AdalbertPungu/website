### New Integrations: GitHub and Outerbase (bumped from last week)

This week we are featuring two new third-party integrations for your Neon project:

- GithHub &#8212;  Connect your Neon project to GitHub for streamlined workflows with GitHub Actions.
- Outerbase &&#8212; View, query, visualize, and edit your Neon data using AI-powered Outerbase.

- Previously, the default autosuspend delay minimum setting for a Neon project under our Launch or Scale plan could be set lower than the minimum plan [limit](/docs/guides/auto-suspend-guide#autosuspend-limits). Moving forward, the plan minimum settings will be enforced. Default settings below the plan's minimum will be automatically adjusted for existing projects. This update will not alter autosuspend settings for existing compute endpoints; those settings will remain unchanged, even if they fall below the plan's minimum. However, the minimum autosuspend limit will be enforced for newly created compute endpoints.

### [06/06] Support for pgvector 0.7.1

Neon now supports [pgvector](/docs/extensions/pgvector) version 0.7.1. This new version improves performance of on-disk HNSW index builds.

For the official list of updates, refer to the [pgvector changelog](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

If you installed this extension previously and want to upgrade to the latest version, please refer to [Update an extension version](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions#update-an-extension-version) for instructions.


### Computes, roles, and databases moved to branch pages in the Neon Console

You can now find your branch's computes, roles, and databases on the branch page they belong to. This update better reflects the relationship of these objects to their specific branches in a Neon project.

With this change, we also moved the compute endpoint delete option to the **Edit compute endpoint** drawer, which you can access by clicking **Edit** on the **Computes** tab.

For more information about how objects in a Neon project are organized and related, see [Overview of the Neon object hierarchy](/docs/manage/overview).

### Fixes & improvements

- [06/06] Fixed an issue with the dynamic rate limiter at the Neon Proxy that caused excessive CPU consumption and prevented new connections from being accepted.
