### Neon Organizations now in Beta

We're happy to announce that the Neon **Organizations** feature is now available in Beta.

![get started with your new org](/docs/manage/org_projects.png)

Create a new organization, transfer over your projects, invite your team members and get started collaborating. The Organizations feature lets you manage all of your team's projects under a single account — with billing, role management, and project transfer capabilities in one accessible location.

See [Neon Organizations](/docs/manage/organizations) to get started. Organizations is a paid account feature.

### Early Access to AI Features in Neon SQL Editor

[Join our Early Access Program](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/early-access) to try out the AI features that we're trialing in the Neon SQL Editor.

There are three AI-driven features to explore:

**1. Text to SQL**: Easily convert natural language requests into SQL. Open the modal, type your request, and the AI assistant will generate the corresponding SQL for you. It’s schema-aware, meaning you can reference any table names, functions, or other objects in your schema.

**2. AI-Generated Query Names**: Descriptive names are automatically assigned to your queries in the Neon SQL Editor's **History**. This feature helps you quickly identify and reuse previously executed queries.

**3. Fix with AI**: If a query fails to execute, simply click **Fix with AI** next to the error message. The AI assistant will analyze the error, fix the query, and update the SQL Editor so you can run the query again.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- We added a **Protect** button to the default branch **Overview** page to make it easier to enable branch protection. The [Protected Branches](/docs/guides/protected-branches) feature is available with the Neon [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans#scale) and [Business](/docs/introduction/plans#business) plans.

- The **Created by** column on the **Branches** page in the Neon Console now displays the creation source for branches created via GitHub or the [Neon Vercel Integration](/docs/guides/vercel#add-the-neon-vercel-integration). Hovering over the creation source will trigger a pop-up that provides links to an associated preview, repository, or code branch, where applicable.

- We now support self-serve account deletion should you need to remove your Neon account for any reason. See [Delete your account](/docs/manage/accounts#delete-your-account) for details.
