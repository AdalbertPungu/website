<details>
<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- We added a **Protect** button to the branch **Overview** page to make it easier to enable branch protection. The [Protected Branches](/docs/guides/protected-branches) feature is available with the Neon [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans#scale) and [Business](/docs/introduction/plans#business) plans.
- [FF] We added a **Connect to GitHub** button to the **Projects** page in the Neon Console. Clicking this button launches the [Neon GitHub Integration](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/neon-github-integration), which lets you connect your Neon project to a corresponding GitHub repository.
- We now support self-serve account deletion should you need to remove your Neon account for any reason. See [Delete your account](/docs/manage/accounts#delete-your-account) for details.
- We've updated the Drizzle Studio version that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console. The new 0.0.17 version fixes an issue the incorrectly adjusted timestamps based on the user's local timezone. For additional improvements and fixes, please refer to the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
