### Neon Organizations now in Beta

We're happy to announce that the Neon **Organizations** feature is now available in Beta.

![get started with your new org](/docs/manage/org_projects.png)

Create a new organization, transfer over your projects, invite your team members and get started collaborating. The Organizations feature lets you manage all of your team's projects under a single account — with billing, role management, and project transfer capabilities in one accessible location.

See [Neon Organizations](/docs/manage/organizations) to learn more. Neon Organizations is a paid plan feature.

### Early Access to AI Features in Neon SQL Editor

[Join our Early Access Program](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/early-access) to try out some AI features that we're trialing in the Neon SQL Editor.

As an Early Access user, you can explore three new AI-driven features:

- **Text to SQL**: Easily convert natural language requests into SQL. Click the **Text2SQL** button, type your request, and the AI assistant will generate the corresponding SQL for you. It’s schema-aware, meaning you can reference any table names, functions, and objects in your schema.  
- **AI-Generated Query Names**: Descriptive names are automatically assigned to your queries in the Neon SQL Editor's **History**. This feature helps you quickly identify and reuse previously executed queries.
- **Fix with AI**: If a query fails to execute, simply click **Fix with AI** next to the error message. The AI assistant will analyze the error, fix the query, and update the SQL Editor so you can run the query again.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- We added a **Protect** button to the branch **Overview** page to make it easier to enable branch protection. The [Protected Branches](/docs/guides/protected-branches) feature is available with the Neon [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans#scale) and [Business](/docs/introduction/plans#business) plans.
- [FF] We added a **Connect to GitHub** button to the **Projects** page in the Neon Console. Clicking this button launches the [Neon GitHub Integration](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/neon-github-integration), which lets you connect your Neon project to a corresponding GitHub repository.
- We now support self-serve account deletion should you need to remove your Neon account for any reason. See [Delete your account](/docs/manage/accounts#delete-your-account) for details.
- We've updated the Drizzle Studio version that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console. The new 0.0.17 version fixes an issue the incorrectly adjusted timestamps based on the user's local timezone. For additional improvements and fixes, please refer to the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
- The **Created by** column on the **Branches** page in the Neon Console now displays the creation source for branches created via GitHub or the [Neon Vercel Integration](/docs/guides/vercel#add-the-neon-vercel-integration). Hovering over the creation source will trigger a pop-up that provides links to an associated preview, repository, or code branch, where applicable.
