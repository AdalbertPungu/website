### Neon Organizations now in Beta

We're happy to announce that the Neon **Organizations** feature is now available in Beta.

![get started with your new org](/docs/manage/org_projects.png)

Create a new organization, transfer over your projects, invite your team members and get started collaborating. The Organizations feature lets you manage all of your team's projects under a single account â€” with billing, role management, and project transfer capabilities in one accessible location.

See [Neon Organizations](/docs/manage/organizations) to learn more. Neon Organizations is a paid plan feature.

### Early Access to Neon SQL Editor AI features

[Join our Early Access Program](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/early-access) to get a first look at some new AI features we're trialing in the Neon SQL Editor.

As an Early Access user, you'll find three separate AI features in the Neon SQL Editor:

- **Text to SQL**: This AI feature converts natural language requests to SQL. Click the **Text2SQL** button to type your request in natural language, click **Go**, and watch as the AI assistant generates the SQL for you. You can include table names, functions, or any object in your schema in your request. The **Text to SQL** feature is schema-aware.
- **AI-generated query names**: Descriptive query names are automatically generated when queries that you run are added to the Neon SQL Editor's **History**. The descriptive names make it easier to identify and reuse previously run queries.
- **Fix with AI**. If a query fails to run and returns an error, you can get immediate assistance by clicking the **Fix with AI** button that accompanies the error message. This feature asks the AI assistant to fix the query and write it to the SQL Editor so that you can run it again.

To learn more about these features and how they are implemented, read the blog post: [AI features in the Neon SQL Edirtor](tbd).

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- We added a **Protect** button to the branch **Overview** page to make it easier to enable branch protection. The [Protected Branches](/docs/guides/protected-branches) feature is available with the Neon [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans#scale) and [Business](/docs/introduction/plans#business) plans.
- [FF] We added a **Connect to GitHub** button to the **Projects** page in the Neon Console. Clicking this button launches the [Neon GitHub Integration](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/neon-github-integration), which lets you connect your Neon project to a corresponding GitHub repository.
- We now support self-serve account deletion should you need to remove your Neon account for any reason. See [Delete your account](/docs/manage/accounts#delete-your-account) for details.
- We've updated the Drizzle Studio version that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console. The new 0.0.17 version fixes an issue the incorrectly adjusted timestamps based on the user's local timezone. For additional improvements and fixes, please refer to the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
- The **Created by** column on the **Branches** page in the Neon Console now displays the creation source for branches created via GitHub or the [Neon Vercel Integration](/docs/guides/vercel#add-the-neon-vercel-integration). Hovering over the creation source will trigger a pop-up that provides links to an associated preview, repository, or code branch, where applicable.
