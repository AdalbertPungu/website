### Clearer language around compute types

Words matter. We've changed our naming convention around compute types: from `RW compute` and `RO Replica` to a cleaner, more straightforward `Primary compute` and `Read replica`.

With Neon's unique architecture, where we separate storage from compute for copy-on-write branching, you can choose the size and features for the compute that powers your branch's database independently from your data.

- **Primary compute** &#8212; When you create a branch in Neon, a primary compute is automatically created alongside it. You can think of your primary compute as the main engine for your branch. It supports read-write operations, though you can modify database permissions using traditional Postgres roles.
- **Read replicas** &#8212; When you’re ready to scale your application, you can direct read-only traffic to one or more read replicas. Unlike traditional systems where data is physically replicated, Neon’s read replicas access the same data source as the primary read-write compute &#8212; at no additional storage cost.

### Self-serve logical replication

You can once again enable [logical replication](/docs/introduction/logical-replication) for your Neon project from the **Settings** &#8594; **Beta** page in the Neon Console. This feature lets you replicate data changes from Neon to external data services and platforms. We have several guides to help you get started:

- [Replicate data with Airbyte](/docs/guides/logical-replication-airbyte)
- [Create an automatic audit trail with Bemi](/docs/guides/bemi)
- [Replicate data to a ClickHouse database on DoubleCloud](/docs/guides/logical-replication-clickhouse)
- [Replicate data with Decodable](/docs/guides/logical-replication-decodable)
- [Replicate data with Kafka (Confluent) and Debezium](/docs/guides/logical-replication-kafka-confluent)
- [Replicate data with Fivetran](/docs/guides/logical-replication-fivetran)
- [Replicate data to Materialize](/docs/guides/logical-replication-materialize)

This feature is currently in Beta. If you've got requests or feedback, let us know via the [Feedback](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=feedback) form in the Neon Console or our [feedback channel](https://discord.com/channels/1176467419317940276/1176788564890112042) on Discord.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- The new `create-app` command in the Neon CLI is maturing fast:
  - It now supports Prisma as another ORM option for your bootstrapped application.
  - It also now creates two separate branches for your app's Neon project: your main branch and a development branch.
