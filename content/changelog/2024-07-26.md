### Clearer language around compute types

Words matter. We've changed our naming convention around compute types: from `RW compute` and `RO Replica` to a cleaner, more straightforward `Primary compute` and `Read replica`.

With Neon's unique architecture, where we separate storage from compute for copy-on-write branching, you can choose the size and features for the compute that powers your branch's database independently from your data.

- **Primary compute** &#8212; When you create a branch in Neon, a primary compute is automatically created alongside it. You can think of your primary compute as the main engine for your branch. It supports read-write operations, though you can modify database permissions using traditional Postgres roles.
- **Read replicas** &#8212; When you’re ready to scale your application, you can direct read-only traffic to one or more read replicas. Unlike traditional systems where data is physically replicated, Neon’s read replicas access the same data source as the primary read-write compute &#8212; at no additional storage cost.

- The new `create-app` command in the Neon CLI is maturing fast:
  - It now supports Prisma as another ORM option for your bootstrapped application.
  - It also now creates two separate branches for your app's Neon project: your main branch and a development branch.
