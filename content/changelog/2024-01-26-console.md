### New default Postgres version

The default version for newly created Neon projects is now Postgres 16. Neon continues to support Postgres 14 and 15.

### Vercel integration updates

- The Vercel environment variables set by the [Neon Vercel Integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon) when you add the integration to a Vercel project have changed. Previously, the integration set all of the following Postgres variables:

    - `DATABASE_URL`
    - `PGHOST`
    - `PGUSER`
    - `PGDATABASE`
    - `PGPASSWORD`

    The integration now sets **only** the `DATABASE_URL` variable by default, which has all of the required details for connecting to your Neon database. 
    
    If you prefer to use the other Postgres variables with your application instead of `DATABASE_URL`, you can now configure the variables you want to use on the **Integrations** page in the Neon console.

    The variables you select are set in your Vercel project on your next push. For details, see [Manage Vercel environment variables](/docs/guides/vercel#manage-vercel-environment-variables).
- Branches created for preview deployments are now created from the primary branch of your Neon project. Previously, the integration created branches from the initial root branch of your Neon project, which is designated as your project's primary branch by default. Neon allows you to [change your primary branch](/docs/manage/branches#set-a-branch-as-primary). If you have an older version of the integration that creates branches from your root branch, and you want branches created from your project's primary branch instead, upgrade your integration by reinstalling it from the Vercel Marketplace.
- Fixed an issue that prevented the `DATABASE_URL` variable from being set on the very first preview deployment after adding the integration to a Vercel project.

### Fixes & improvements

- We now expose more details in error messages returned from the Neon proxy for [Neon serverless driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) connections over HTTP.
- Added a **Submit feedback** form to integration cards that appear on the **Integrations** page in the Neon Console to allow users to share their experience with the integration.
- Enhanced the IP Allow user interface with some minor design and copy adjustments.
- The [List projects](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojects) API method now returns only projects owned by the current user account. Previously, it returned both owned projects and projects shared with the current user account. To list projects shared with the current user account, you can use the [List shared projects](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listsharedprojects) API method.
