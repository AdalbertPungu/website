### New default Postgres version

The default version for newly created Neon projects is now Postgres 16. Neon continues to support Postgres 14 and 15.

### Vercel integration updates

- The environment variables set by the [Neon Vercel Integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon) when you add the integration to a Vercel project have changed. Previously, the integration set the following Postgres variables:

    - `DATABASE_URL`
    - `PGHOST`
    - `PGUSER`
    - `PGDATABASE`
    - `PGPASSWORD`

    The integration now sets **only** the `DATABASE_URL` variable by default, which includes all of the required details for connecting to your Neon database. 
    
    If you prefer to use the other Postgres variables with your application instead of `DATABASE_URL`, you can now configure the variables you want on the **Integrations** page in the Neon console. 
    
    ![Select Vercel variables](/docs/guides/vercel_select_variables.png)

    The variables you select are set in your Vercel project on your next `git push`. For details, see [Manage Vercel environment variables](/docs/guides/vercel#manage-vercel-environment-variables).
- Branches created for preview deployments are now created from the primary branch of your Neon project. Previously, the integration created branches from the root branch of your Neon project, which is designated as your project's primary branch by default. Neon allows you to [change your primary branch](/docs/manage/branches#set-a-branch-as-primary). If you have an older version of the integration that creates branches from your root branch and you want branches created from your project's primary branch instead, reinstall the integration from the Vercel Marketplace.
- Fixed an issue that prevented the `DATABASE_URL` variable from being set on the first preview deployment after adding the integration to a Vercel project.

### Fixes & improvements

- The [List projects](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojects) API method now returns only projects owned by the current user account. Previously, it also returned projects shared with the current user account. To list projects shared with the current user account, use the [List shared projects](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listsharedprojects) API method instead.
- Added a **Submit feedback** form to the cards on the **Integrations** page in the Neon Console, allowing users to share their experience with Neon integrations.
- We now expose more details in error messages returned from the Neon proxy for [Neon serverless driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) connections over HTTP.
- Improved the [IP Allow](/docs/introduction/ip-allow) user interface with minor design and copy adjustments.
