### Support for Postgres 17

Neon is pleased to announce support for Postgres 17. To use Postgres 17 with Neon, create a new Neon project and select **17** as the **Postgres version**. See [Create a project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project) for instructions.

To migrate data from an existing Neon project to one created with Postgres 17, refer to [Upgrading your Postgres version](/docs/postgresql/postgres-upgrade) for supported migration methods.

As with any database migration, always test thoroughly before migrating production data or applications. Also, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the changes in Postgres 17. For information about those changes, please refer to the official [Postgres Release 17 documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/release-17.html).

If you need to migrate data from an existing Neon project to one running Postgres 17, check out our [Upgrading your Postgres version](/docs/postgresql/postgres-upgrade) guide for supported data migration options.

As always, it's crucial to test thoroughly before migrating production data or applications. We also recommend reviewing the key changes in Postgres 17. You can find the full details in the [Postgres Release 17 documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/release-17.html).

### Early Access to AI Features in Neon SQL Editor

[Join our Early Access Program](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/early-access) to try out the AI features that we're trialing in the Neon SQL Editor.

There are three AI-driven features to explore:

**1. SQL generation**: Easily convert natural language requests to SQL. Press the ✨ button or **Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+M**, type your request, and the AI assistant will generate the corresponding SQL for you. It’s schema-aware, meaning you can reference any table names, functions, or other objects in your schema.

**2. Fix with AI**: If your query returns an error, simply click **Fix with AI** next to the error message. The AI assistant will analyze the error, suggest a fix, and update the SQL Editor so you can run the query again.

**3. AI-Generated Query Names**: Descriptive names are automatically assigned to your queries in the Neon SQL Editor's **History**. This feature helps you quickly identify and reuse previously executed queries.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- [FF] We added a **Connect to GitHub** button to the **Projects** page in the Neon Console. Clicking this button launches the [Neon GitHub Integration](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/neon-github-integration), which lets you connect your Neon project to a corresponding GitHub repository.
- We've updated the Drizzle Studio version that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console. The new 0.0.17 version fixes an issue the incorrectly adjusted timestamps based on the user's local timezone. For additional improvements and fixes, please refer to the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
