### Early Access to AI Features in Neon SQL Editor

[Join our Early Access Program](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/early-access) to try out the AI features that we're trialing in the Neon SQL Editor.

There are three AI-driven features to explore:

**1. Text to SQL**: Easily convert natural language requests into SQL. Open the modal, type your request, and the AI assistant will generate the corresponding SQL for you. Itâ€™s schema-aware, meaning you can reference any table names, functions, or other objects in your schema.

**2. Fix with AI**: If a query fails to execute, simply click **Fix with AI** next to the error message. The AI assistant will analyze the error, fix the query, and update the SQL Editor so you can run the query again.

**3. AI-Generated Query Names**: Descriptive names are automatically assigned to your queries in the Neon SQL Editor's **History**. This feature helps you quickly identify and reuse previously executed queries.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- [FF] We added a **Connect to GitHub** button to the **Projects** page in the Neon Console. Clicking this button launches the [Neon GitHub Integration](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/neon-github-integration), which lets you connect your Neon project to a corresponding GitHub repository.
- We've updated the Drizzle Studio version that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console. The new 0.0.17 version fixes an issue the incorrectly adjusted timestamps based on the user's local timezone. For additional improvements and fixes, please refer to the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
