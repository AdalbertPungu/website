### Re-organized Integrations page

As our list of Integrations continues to grow, we've added categorized navigation, making it easier to explore what's offered. Click a category heading and then **Add** or **Request** the integrations you're interested in.

### Neon Vercel Integration enhancements

The Vercel integration drawer in the Neon console now supports viewing and deleting preview deployment branches and defining a default database and role for new preview deployment branches.

### Fixes & improvements

- You can now view the sign-in methods configured for your Neon account from the **Profile** page under **Account Settings**. The **Profile** page also supports unlinking social accounts such as Google or GitHub from your Neon account.
- When creating a project, the default Postgres role created with your project is now named for the database using the following naming scheme: `dbname_owner`, where _dbname_ is the name of the database. This change reflects that the default Postgres role is the owner of the initial database that is created with the project.
- The Consumption API endpoint is now fully available and no longer in Preview status. You can use this endpoint to get a full list of key consumption metrics for all the projects in your Neon account in a single API request. For more info:
    - [Consumption API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojectsconsumption)
    - [Retrieving metrics for all projects](/docs/guides/partner-billing#retrieving-metrics-for-all-projects) 
- You are now able to downgrade directly from **Scale** to **Launch** when that fits your usage needs. Previously, you needed to downgrade to Free tier first before then moving back up to Launch.
