### Neon Vercel Integration enhancements

The Vercel integration drawer in the Neon console now supports viewing and deleting preview deployment branches and defining a default database and role for new preview deployment branches.

### Drizzle Studio Integration into Neon Console
We've integrated Drizzle Studio into the Neon Console, which lets you browse, add, update, and delete records from directly within the Neon Console. The Drizzle Studio integration also supports downloading data in `.json` and `.csv` file formats. You can access the Drizzle Studio integration from sidebar in the Neon console.

### Local File Cache (LFC) statistics and working set size function
You can now view Local File Cache (LFC) statistics for your Neon compute. The statistics include a cache hit ratio, which can help you determine if your data is being accessed from memory or the Neon storage layer.
The Local File Cache (LFC) is a layer of caching that stores frequently accessed data in the local memory of your Neon compute instance. The cache helps to reduce latency and improve query performance by minimizing the need to fetch data from the Neon storage layer. The LFC acts as an add-on or extension of Postgres [shared buffers](#shared-buffers). In Neon, the `shared_buffers` setting is always 128 MB, regardless of compute size. The LFC extends cache memory up to 50% of your compute's RAM.
Local File Cache (LFC) statistics are exposed through a `neon_stat_file_cache view`, which you access by installing the `neon` extension.
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION neon;
```
You can run the following query to view statistics:
```sql
SELECT * FROM neon.neon_stat_file_cache;
 file_cache_misses | file_cache_hits | file_cache_used | file_cache_writes | file_cache_hit_ratio
-------------------+-----------------+-----------------+-------------------+----------------------
           2133643 |       108999742 |             607 |          10767410 |                98.08
```
You can also use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` with the `FILECACHE` option to view LFC cache hit and miss data.
Additionally, the `neon` extension now provides an `approximate_working_set_size()` function that can be used to estimate your working set size. Ideally, your working set should fit in your computes memory.
For more information, see [The neon extension](https://neon.tech/docs/extensions/neon). To learn how the LFC cache hit ratio and `approximate_working_set_size()` function can help you right-size your compute, see [How to size your compute](/docs/manage/endpoints#how-to-size-your-compute).

### PostgreSQL Partition Manager extension

We added support for the [pg_partman](https://github.com/pgpartman/pg_partman) Postgres extension, which lets you create and manage time-based and number-based table partition sets.

### Fixes & improvements

- You can now view the sign-in methods configured for your Neon account from the **Profile** page under **Account Settings**. The **Profile** page also supports unlinking social accounts such as Google or GitHub from your Neon account.
- When creating a project, the default Postgres role created with your project is now named for the database using the following naming scheme: `dbname_owner`, where _dbname_ is the name of the database. This change reflects that the default Postgres role is the owner of the initial database that is created with the project.
