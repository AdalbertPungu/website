### Re-organized Integrations page

As our list of Integrations continues to grow, we've added categorized navigation, making it easier to explore what's offered. Click a category heading and then **Add** or **Request** the integrations you're interested in.

### Neon Vercel Integration enhancements

- **Manage branches created by the integration**: The Neon Vercel Integration creates a branch for each preview deployment. To avoid using up your storage or branch allowances, we recommend removing old or obsolete branches regularly. You can now do this from the **Vercel integration** drawer in the Neon Console. See [Manage branches created by the integration](/docs/guides/vercel#manage-branches-created-by-the-integration).
- **Change the database and role for preview branches**: When you install the integration, you select a database and role for your Neon project. The integration uses these details to define database connection variables for your preview branches. You can now change the database and role for new preview branches from the **Vercel integration** drawer in the Neon Console. See [Change the database and role for preview branches](/docs/guides/vercel#change-the-database-and-role-for-preview-branches).
- Fixed an issue that prevented Vercel environment variables created by the integration from being removed when deleting the associated Neon project.

### Fixes & improvements

- You can now view the sign-in methods configured for your Neon account from the **Profile** page under **Account Settings**. The **Profile** page also supports unlinking social accounts such as Google or GitHub from your Neon account.
- When creating a project, the default Postgres role created with your project is now named for the database using the following naming scheme: `dbname_owner`, where _dbname_ is the name of the database. This change reflects that the default Postgres role is the owner of the initial database that is created with the project.
- The Consumption API endpoint is now fully available and no longer in Preview status. You can use this endpoint to get a full list of key consumption metrics for all the projects in your Neon account in a single API request. For more info:
    - [Consumption API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojectsconsumption)
    - [Retrieving metrics for all projects](/docs/guides/partner-billing#retrieving-metrics-for-all-projects) 
- You are now able to downgrade directly from **Scale** to **Launch** when that fits your usage needs. Previously, you needed to downgrade to Free tier first before then moving back up to Launch.
