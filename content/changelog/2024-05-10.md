### Custom Period Selector for the Monitoring Dashboard

You can now select a custom time period when viewing database metrics on the **Monitoring** page in the Neon Console. This feature gives you the flexibility of choosing exact start and end dates and times for your monitoring period, helping you with both short-term and long-term trend analysis. To try it out, go to the **Monitoring** page in the Neon Console and select **Custom** from the **Other** menu.

### Export query results to CSV, JSON and XLSX in the Neon SQL Editor

The Neon SQL Editor now supports exporting query results to CSV, JSON and XLSX formats. Additionally, you can expand your query results view to the entire SQL Editor window. You can access buttons for both features from the bottom right corner of the **SQL Editor** page.

### Fixes & improvements

- To make it even easier to try Neon, we've removed the **First Name**, **Last Name**, and **Password confirmation** fields from the Neon **Sign Up** page. If you're signing up for Neon with an email account, only an email address is required.
- Fixed an issue that prevented the current storage usage from being displayed when entering a new billing period, making it appear that storage usage was reset to zero.
- Adjusted the location of the **Quickstart** in the Neon Console sidebar and other minor improvements.
- The Neon CLI `connection-string` command and Neon API [Get connection URI](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getconnectionuri) method now generate a connection URI with a `postgresql://` scheme designator instead of the shorter `postgres://` designator. While both designators are [valid](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING-URIS), we have found the longer version to be more widely supported.
- Error information was improved for HTTP fetch queries using the [Neon serverless driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver). For a log of the latest updates to Neon's serverless driver, you can also refer to the [Neon serverless driver changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
- Fixed an issue that prevented the current endpoint status from displaying properly in the Neon Console.
- Added validation for _Autosuspend_ minimum settings. Each of [Neon's plans](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/plans) has a different minimum setting for the Autosuspend feature. For details, see [Autosuspend limits](/docs/guides/auto-suspend-guide#autosuspend-limits).
- Auth0, Clerk, Okta, Sequin cards on the **Integrations** page in the Neon Console are now linked to our documentation for those platforms. Clicking on the **Read** button on the integration card opens a documentation drawer.
- Fixed an issue in the **SQL Editor** that caused it to display a `Ready` status on page load when the editor was not yet connected. The editor now displays a valid `Connected` or `Ready to connect` status.
- Fixed an issue that caused changes made in the **Edit compute endpoint** drawer accessed from the **Monitoring** widget to disappear after closing and reopening the drawer.
- Fixed an issue with the password reveal functionality in the **Connection Details** widget.
