### Custom Period Selector for the Monitoring Dashboard

Users can now specify a custom time period for viewing database metrics. This feature enhances the flexibility of monitoring by allowing the selection of exact start and end dates and times, catering to both short-term analyses and long-term trends. Navigate to **Other > Custom** on the **Monitoring** dashboard in the Neon Console to try this new feature.

### Export query results to CSV, JSON and XLSX and expand the results window in the Neon SQL Editor

The Neon SQL Editor now supports exporting your data to CSV, JSON and XLSX formats. Additionally, you can expand query results to the entire window. You can access buttons for both features from the bottom right corner of the **SQL Editor** page.

### Fixes & improvements

- To make it even easier to try Neon, we've removed the **First Name**, **Last Name**, and **Password confirmation** fields from the Neon **Sign Up** page. If you're signing up with an email account, only your email address is required.
- Fixed an issue that prevented the current storage usage from being displayed immediately when entering a new billing period, making it appear that storage usage had been reset to zero.
- Adjusted the location of the **Quickstart** in the Neon Console sidebar and other minor improvements.
- The Neon CLI `connection-string` command and Neon API [Get connection URI](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getconnectionuri) method now generate a connection URI with a `postgresql://` scheme designator instead of the shorter `postgres://` designator. While both designators are [valid](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING-URIS), we have found the longer version to be more widely supported.
- Error information was improved for HTTP fetch queries using the [Neon serverless driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver). For a log of the latest updates to Neon's serverless driver, you can also refer to the [Neon serverless driver changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
- [5/10] Fixed an issue that prevented the current endpoint status from being properly displayed in the Neon Console.
- [5/10] Added validation for _Autosuspend_ minimum setting limits. Each of [Neon's plans](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/plans) has a different minimum setting limit. For details, see [Autosuspend limits](/docs/guides/auto-suspend-guide#autosuspend-limits).
- [5/10] Integration cards on the **Integrtions** page in the Neon Console for Auth0, Clerk, Okta, Sequin are now linked to our documentation for those platforms. Clicking on the **Read** button on the integration card now opens a documentation drawer.
- [5/10] Fixed an issue in the **SQL Editor** that caused it to display a `Ready` status on page load when it was not yet connected. The editor now displays valid `Connected` or `Ready to connect` statuses.
- [5/10] Fixed an issue that caused changes made in the **Edit compute endpoint** drawer accessed from the **Monitoring** widget on the project dashboard  to disappear after closing and reopening the drawer.
- [5/10] Fixed an issue with the password reveal functionality in the **Connection Details** widget on the project dashboard.
