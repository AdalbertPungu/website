### Drizzle Studio in the Neon Console

We've integrated Drizzle Studio into the Neon Console, which lets you browse, add, update, and delete records from directly within the Neon Console. The Drizzle Studio integration also supports downloading data in `.json` and `.csv` file formats. You can access the Drizzle Studio integration from sidebar in the Neon console.

### Fixes & improvements

- We've removed the **First Name** and **Last Name** fields from the Neon **Sign Up** page. If you're signing up with an email account, you only need to provide an email address.
