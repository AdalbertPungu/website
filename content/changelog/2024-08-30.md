### Autoscaling is now GA

![visualization for autoscaling](/docs/introduction/autoscaling_intro.png)

In case you missed the [announcement](https://neon.tech/blog/neon-autoscaling-is-generally-available) earlier this week, we're excited to let you know that Neon's Autoscaling feature is now generally available. Autoscaling has been a core objective for Neon from the very beginning. With Autoscaling, your database automatically adjusts its compute resources up or down based on demand, including scaling down to zero when not in use. This feature is now ready for production, making it easier than ever to manage workloads efficiently.

If you're not yet familiar with Neon's Autoscaling feature, you can learn more here:

- [An introduction to Neon's Autoscaling](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/autoscaling)
- [Understanding Neon's Autoscaling algorithm](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/autoscaling-algorithm)
- [Enabling Autoscaling](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/autoscaling-guide)

### Autoscaling on the Free Plan

In addition to our Autoscaling GA announcement, we've made Autoscaling available on our [Free Plan](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/plans#free-plan), where you can automatically scale computes from 0.25 vCPU with 1 GB of RAM up to 2 vCPU with 8 GB of RAM. To learn how to enable Autoscaling, see [Enabling Autoscaling](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/autoscaling-guide).

When you try Autoscaling on the Free Plan, we recommend [monitoring your monthly compute hour allowance](/docs/introduction/monitor-usage). A compute that scales up regularly will consume your monthly compute hour allowance more quickly.

### Postgres version updates

Supported Postgres versions were updated to [14.13](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.13/), [15.8](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/15.8/), and [16.4](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/16.4/), respectively.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- The [Reset a Neon branch](https://github.com/neondatabase/reset-branch-action) GitHub Action, which resets a child branch with the latest data from its parent branch, now outputs connection string values. New outputs include:
  - `branch_id`: The ID of the newly reset branch.
  - `db_url`: Database connection string for the branch after the reset.
  - `db_url_with_pooler`: The pooled database connection string for the branch after the reset.
  - `host`: The branch host after the reset.
  - `host_with_pooler`: The branch host with pooling after the reset.
  - `password`: The password for connecting to the branch database after the reset.
- We've revamped the **Usage** widget on the Project Dashboard for Free Plan users, making it easier to monitor your usage allowances. Now prominently positioned at the top of the dashboard, the **Usage** widget provides an at-a-glance view of your monthly totals for Storage, Compute, Branch compute, and Branches. For an overview of Neon Free Plan allowances, please see [Free Plan](/docs/introduction/plans#free-plan).
- Fixed an issued with the Neon CLI's `neonctl -v` command. The command returned `unknown` instead of the CLI version number. Thanks to our community member [@mrl5](https://github.com/mrl5) for the contribution.
- Fixed an issue with the Neon Docs site navigation. Thanks to our community member [@lemorage](https://github.com/lemorage) for the contribution.
