### Autoscaling is now GA

![visualization for autoscaling](/docs/introduction/autoscaling_intro.png)

In case you missed the [announcement](https://neon.tech/blog/neon-autoscaling-is-generally-available) earlier this week, Neon's Autoscaling feature officially graduated out of beta and is now GA. Building autoscaling has been a primary goal for Neon since we launched. A serverless experience for Postgres had to include a compute layer that scaled up and down automatically, including scaling to zero when the database was not in use.

If you're not yet familiar with Neon's Autoscaling feature yet, you can learn more here:

- [An introduction to Neon's Autoscaling](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/autoscaling)
- [Understanding Neon's Autoscaling algorithm](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/autoscaling-algorithm)
- [Enabling Autoscaling](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/autoscaling-guide)

### Autoscaling is now available on the Free Tier

In addition to the Autoscaling GA announcement, we've made Autoscaling available on our [Free Plan](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/plans#free-plan), letting Free Plan users automatically scale computes from 0.25 vCPU with 1 GB of RAM up to 2 vCPU with 8 GB of RAM based on demand. To learn how to enable Autoscaling, see [Enabling Autoscaling](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/autoscaling-guide).

When you try Autoscaling on the Free Plan, we recommend [keeping an eye on your monthly compute hour allowance](/docs/introduction/monitor-usage). A compute that scales up regularly will use up your allowance more quickly.

### Postgres version updates

Supported Postgres versions were updated to [14.13](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.13/), [15.8](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/15.8/), and [16.4](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/16.4/), respectively.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- The [Reset a Neon branch](https://github.com/neondatabase/reset-branch-action) GitHub Action, which resets a child branch with the latest data from its parent branch, now outputs connection string values. New outputs include:
  - `branch_id`: The ID of the newly reset branch.
  - `db_url`: Database connection string for the branch after the reset.
  - `db_url_with_pooler`: The pooled database connection string for the branch after the reset.
  - `host`: The branch host after the reset.
  - `host_with_pooler`: The branch host with pooling after the reset.
  - `password`: The password for connecting to the branch database after the reset.
- We've revamped the **Usage** widget on the Project Dashboard for Free Plan users, making it easier than ever to monitor your metrics. Now prominently positioned at the top of the dashboard, the **Usage** widget provides an at-a-glance view of your monthly totals for Storage, Compute, Branch compute, and Branches. For an overview of Neon Free Plan allowances, please see [Free Plan](/docs/introduction/plans#free-plan).
- Fix an issued with the Neon CLI's `neonctl -v` command. The commands returned `unknown` instead of the CLI version. Thank you to [mrl5](https://github.com/mrl5) for the fix.
