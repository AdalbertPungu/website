### Support for pgvector 0.6.0

The `pgvector` extension for vector similarity search in Postgres was updated to a newer version.

| Postgres extension           | Old version   | New version   |
|------------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| `pgvector`                   | 0.5.1         | 0.6.0         |

The new version of `pgvector` adds several HNSW index improvements including support for parallel index builds. For other updates, refer to the [pgvector changelog](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

If you installed this extension previously and want to upgrade to the latest version, please refer to [Update an extension version](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions#update-an-extension-version) for instructions.

For a complete list of Postgres extensions supported by Neon, see [Postgres extensions](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions).

## Support for PgBouncer 1.22.0

The PgBouncer version used by Neon to offer pooled connection support was updated to [version 1.22.0](https://www.pgbouncer.org/changelog.html#pgbouncer-122x). This version of PgBouncer adds support for `DEALLOCATE ALL` and `DISCARD ALL` in transaction mode when `max_prepared_statements` is set to a non-zero value. In Neon, the new version of PgBouncer enables support for protocol-level prepared statements for pooled database connections.

## Support for prepared statements with PgBouncer

Neon now supports protocol-level prepared statements with PgBouncer, which means you can now use prepared statements with pooled connections. Using prepared statements can help boost query performance while providing an added layer of protection against potential SQL injection attacks. To learn more, see [Optimize queries with PgBouncer and prepared statements](/docs/connect/connection-pooling#optimize-queries-with-pgbouncer-and-prepared-statements) in the docs or read the [blog post](tbd).

### Fixes & improvements

- FOR ALL TABLES in logical replication
- Creating a bran ch from the connection widget
- psql commands in SQL editor
- Neon as subscriber?
- The **Quickstart** banner that appears at the top of the Neon **Dashboard** for newly created projects now includes commands for creating and listing branches using the [Neon CLI](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/neon-cli).
