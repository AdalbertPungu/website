### Support for pgvector 0.7.0

We've updated our [pgvector](/docs/extensions/pgvector) extension to version 0.7.0. This new version of `pgvector` adds the following features and enhancements:

- New vector types: `halfvec` and `sparsevec`
- Support for indexing `bit` type for binary vectors
- Support for quantizing vectors using the `binary_quantize` function 
- New distance functions: `hamming_distance` and `jaccard_distance`
- HNSW indexing for L1 distance operations
- Support for CPU dispatching for distance functions on Linux x86-64

For the official list of updates, refer to the [pgvector changelog](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

If you installed this extension previously and want to upgrade to the latest version, please refer to [Update an extension version](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions#update-an-extension-version) for instructions.

For a complete list of Postgres extensions supported by Neon, see [Postgres extensions](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions).

### Drizzle Studio in the Neon Console

We're excited to announce that the **Tables** page in the Neon Console, which lets you explore the tables and data in your Neon databases, is now powered by [Drizzle Studio](https://orm.drizzle.team/drizzle-studio/overview). This integration introduces several new capabilities to the **Tables** page including the ability to add, update, and delete records, filter data, add or remove columns, drop or truncate tables, and export data in `.json` and `.csv` formats.

### Postgres version updates

The Postgres versions supported by Neon have been updated to [14.12](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.12/), [15.7](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/15.7/), and [16.3](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/16.3/), respectively.

## Fixes & improvements

- The Neon CLI [connection-string](/docs/reference/cli-connection-string) command and the Neon API [Get connection URI](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getconnectionuri) method now generate a connection URI with a `postgresql://` scheme designator instead of the shorter `postgres://` designator. While both scheme designators are [valid](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING-URIS), we found the longer version to be more widely supported.
- Added validation for _Autosuspend_ minimum settings. For setting details, see [Autosuspend limits](/docs/guides/auto-suspend-guide#autosuspend-limits).
- Added a **Charges to date** field to the **Billing summary** section of the **Billing** page.
- You can now access the **Edit compute endpoint** modal from the **Branches** widget on the **Dashboard** by clicking the compute endpoint link.
- Fixed an issue on the **Branches** page that prevented a new branch from being listed on the page immediately after being created.
- Fixed a styling issue that prevented the "Forgot password?" link from being fully visible on the Neon sign-in page while in dark mode.
