### stashed items

From 05-10 release that did not make it:
- Added validation for _Autosuspend_ minimum settings. Each of [Neon's plans](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/plans) has a different minimum setting for the Autosuspend feature. For details, see [Autosuspend limits](/docs/guides/auto-suspend-guide#autosuspend-limits).


### Drizzle Studio in the Neon Console

We've integrated Drizzle Studio into the Neon Console, which lets you browse, add, update, and delete records from directly within the Neon Console. The Drizzle Studio integration also supports downloading data in `.json` and `.csv` file formats. You can access the Drizzle Studio integration from sidebar in the Neon console.
