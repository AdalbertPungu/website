### Fixes & improvements

- We have updated our [status](https://neonstatus.com/) page to be per-region, so that customers can view events and history for the regions their databases are running in.

## Free Tier egress limit

From 1st May 2024, Neon's Free plan will include a 5 GB per month [egress](/docs/reference/glossary#egress) limit.

## Other

## Monitoring dashboard

We've added a Monitoring dashboard to the Neon Console that provides key Postgres, connection, and resource usage metrics.

## Schema Diff

We've added a Schema Diff tool that lets you precisely compare database schemas between different branches to help streamline your integration process.

## Time Travel from the SQL Editor

To help with data recovery workflows, we've made our Time Travel Assist feature available in the SQL Editor in the Neon Console. Time Travel Assist is also available now on the **Restore** page, but it's a great feature and we wanted to make it more convenient for you to use, wherever you might need it in the console.

## Last active time for branches

You can now view the last active time for a branch, which helps you identify branches have been used recently. For example, the last active time can be used to identify unused branches. This feature is supported in the Neon Console, CLI, and API.

## Support for psql meta-commands in SQL Editor 

We added support for `psql` meta-commands to the SQL Editor in the Neon Console. Meta-commands can significantly speed up your workflow by providing quick access to database schemas and other critical information without needing to write full SQL queries. They are especially useful for database management tasks, making it easier to handle administrative duties directly from the Neon Console.

Here are some of the meta-commands that you can use within the Neon SQL Editor:

- `\dt` — List all tables in the current database.
- `\d [table_name]` — Describe a table's structure.
- `\l` — List all databases.
- `\?` - A cheat sheet of available meta-commands
- `\h [NAME]` - Get help for any Postgres command. For example, try `\h SELECT`.

Note that not all meta-commands are supported in the SQL Editor. To get a list of supported commands, use `\?`.

### Drizzle Studio in the Neon Console

We've integrated Drizzle Studio into the Neon Console, which lets you browse, add, update, and delete records from directly within the Neon Console. The Drizzle Studio integration also supports downloading data in `.json` and `.csv` file formats. You can access the Drizzle Studio integration from sidebar in the Neon console.

### Neon Serverless driver JavaScript Registry (JSR) package

The Neon serverless driver is now available as a [JavaScript Registry (JSR)](https://jsr.io/docs/introduction) package: [https://jsr.io/@neon/serverless](https://jsr.io/@neon/serverless). The JavaScript Registry (JSR) is a package registry for JavaScript and TypeScript. JSR works with many runtimes (Node.js, Deno, browsers, and more) and is backward compatible with `npm`.
