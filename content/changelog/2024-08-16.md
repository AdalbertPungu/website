### TBD

<details>
<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- In the **Add new compute** and **Edit compute settings** drawers, the **Seconds** option in the **Autosuspend time** drop-down is now hidden when the minimum setting is 60 seconds or more, or if the current setting is already in seconds.
- We improved the message displayed in the SQL Editor when a connection is closed due to inactivity. The previous error message, `Terminating connection due to administrator command`, was changed to a notification: `The connection was closed due to inactivity. It will automatically reopen when you run your next query`.
- In the Neon SQL Editor, queries saved to **History** are now limited to 10 KB in length. While you can execute longer queries from the SQL Editor, any query exceeding 10 KB will be truncated when saved to the **History**. A `-- QUERY TRUNCATED` comment is added at the beginning of these queries to indicate truncation. Additionally, if you input a query longer than 10 KB in the SQL Editor, a warning similar to the following will appear: `This query will still run, but the last 1234 characters will be truncated from query history`.
- The **Create new database** option in the **Database** drop-down menu within the **Connection Details** widget has been fixed. Previously, this option was not functioning.
- We've updated the Drizzle Studio version that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console. This update addresses issues related to parsing the default value of `jsonb` column and repeating of column names for columns with the same constraint name.
- Fixed an issue that resulted in a a password-related error when switching between projects in the Neon SQL Editor.
