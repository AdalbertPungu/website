### More CLI support for Organizations

For users of Neon's [Organizations](/docs/manage/organizations) feature, which is currently in private preview, the Neon CLI [projects](/docs/reference/cli-projects) command now supports an `--org-id` option, allowing you to list or create projects in a specified organization; for example, you can list projects in an organization with the following command:



Additionally, the Neon CLI [set-context](/docs/reference/cli-set-context) command now lets you set an organization context so that you don't have to specify an organization ID when running CLI commands.

### New Neon documentation sidebar

We've updated the Neon documentation sidebar to improve navigation. The new sidebar provides flatter structure than the previous expandable/collapsible sidebar, which makes it easier to scan and find content at a glance. Additionally, the new navigation adds icons for each content category and support for second-level sidebars that will allow us to grow and manage our content moving forward. Our documentation set is growing quickly. We hope this navigation enhancement will prepare us for expansion in the months and years to come while improving user experience today.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- For users of Neon's [Organizations](/docs/manage/organizations) feature, which is currently in private preview, the Neon CLI [projects](/docs/reference/cli-projects) command now supports an `--org-id` option, allowing you to list or create projects in a specified organization. Additionally, the Neon CLI [set-context](/docs/reference/cli-set-context) command now lets you set an organization context so that you don't have to specify an organization ID when running CLI commands.
- In the **Add new compute** and **Edit compute settings** drawers, the **Seconds** option in the **Autosuspend time** drop-down is now hidden when the minimum setting is 60 seconds or more, or if the current setting is already in seconds.
- We improved the message displayed in the SQL Editor when a connection is closed due to inactivity. The previous error message, `Terminating connection due to administrator command`, was changed to a notification: `The connection was closed due to inactivity. It will automatically reopen when you run your next query`.
- In the Neon SQL Editor, queries saved to **History** are now limited to 10 KB in length. While you can execute longer queries from the SQL Editor, any query exceeding 9 KB will be truncated when saved to the **History**. A `-- QUERY TRUNCATED` comment is added at the beginning of these queries to indicate truncation. Additionally, if you input a query longer than 10 KB in the SQL Editor, a warning similar to the following will appear: `This query will still run, but the last 1234 characters will be truncated from query history`.
- The **Create new database** option in the **Database** drop-down menu within the **Connection Details** widget has been fixed. Previously, this option was not functioning.
- We've updated the Drizzle Studio version that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console. This update addresses issues related to parsing the default value of `jsonb` column and repeating of column names for columns with the same constraint name.
- Fixed an issue that resulted in a password-related error when switching between projects in the Neon SQL Editor.
- Optimized the various options and selectors at the top of the Neon SQL Editor to better fit smaller screen sizes.
- Corrected an issue that caused `Something went wrong` error to be shown after deleting a project from the **Settings** page.
- Time values on the **Monitoring** page graphs, including those in hover help and on the x-axis, are now displayed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) instead of the local time zone. This change ensures consistency, as the time values now match the format used in date-range selectors when setting custom periods for monitoring graphs.
