### Fixes & improvements

- The selected branch and database are now preserved when moving between the **SQL Editor** and the **Tables** page in the Neon Console.
- Fixed an issue that prevented creating a new branch in the Neon Console using a Safari browser when selecting a specific date and time as the branch creation point. The issue resulted in an `Invalid Date` error.
- Fixed an issue in the Neon Console that caused the history retention setting for a shared project to differ from the project owner's history retention setting.
- [NOT SEEING THIS] Added a **Compute Inactive** metric to the **CPU** and **Database size** chart legends on the Monitoring page in the Neon Console to identify periods when a compute is idle. 
- Added a system status indicator to the Neon Console pager header, next to the alerts icon. System status was previously displayed in the alerts menu where it was not immediately visible.
- Fixed an issue in the Neon Vercel Integration to better handle errors reported for variables set by the integration that already exist in Vercel. The issue caused preview deployment failures.
