### Explore Postgres extensions from the Neon Console

The Postgres extension ecosystem lets you customize and extend your database's capabilities. By integrating extensions, you can add advanced functionalities across a broad range of categories such as analytics, data transformation, full-text search, geospatial data processing, and more. Neon supports over 70 Postgres extensions.

You can now explore all of Neon's supported extensions directly from the console. We've added an **Install Extensions** section to the **Quickstart**, which you can access from the Neon Console sidebar.

Click **Install** to view the required `CREATE EXTENSION` command, which you can run in the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor) or any connected SQL client, and click **Docs** to view extension documentation.

### Added protection for default and protected branches

To enhance the protection of [default](/docs/manage/branches#protected-branch) and [protected](/docs/guides/protected-branches) branches, we've disabled the **Delete** action for those branches in the Neon Console.

To delete a default branch, you must now set a different branch as the default first. Before deleting a protected branch, you have to change its status to unprotected.

[Protected branches](/docs/guides/protected-branches) are a Neon [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans#scale) plan feature.

### Fixes & improvements

- The selected branch and database are now preserved when moving between the **SQL Editor** and the **Tables** page in the Neon Console.
- Fixed an issue that prevented creating a new branch in the Neon Console using a Safari browser when selecting a specific date and time as the branch creation point. The issue resulted in an `Invalid Date` error.
- Fixed an issue in the Neon Console that caused the history retention setting for a shared project to differ from the project owner's history retention setting.
- [NOT SEEING THIS YET!] Added an **Endpoint Inactive** legend item to the **CPU** and **Database Size** charts on the **Monitoring** page in the Neon Console. This legend item highlights periods when the compute endpoint was suspended, indicating no available data for those times.
- Added a system status indicator to the Neon Console pager header, next to the alerts icon. System status was previously displayed in the alerts menu where it was not immediately visible.
- Fixed an issue in the Neon Vercel Integration to better handle errors reported for variables set by the integration that already exist in Vercel. The issue caused preview deployment failures.
- Added a `psql -h pg.neon.tech` connection snippet to the **Connection Details** widget. Instead of supplying a connection string when connecting with `psql`, you can use `psql -h pg.neon.tech` at the command line to launch a browser-based authentication flow.
- Fixed an issue on the RAM and CPU charts on the **Monitoring** page in the Neon Console. The verticle axis scale was not displayed properly.
- For Free Tier accounts, a **Data transfer** usage metric was added to **Resources remaining** widget on the Project Dashboard. The Neon Free Tier has a 5 GiB per month [data transfer](/docs/introduction/usage-metrics#data-transfer) allowance.
- For Free Tier users with access to shared projects, clicking an **upgrade plan** link within the shared project now displays a modal directing the shared project user to contact the project owner.
- Added RAM and vCPU alerts to the Neon Console to let you know when you're getting close to your plan limits.
