### Added autoscaling opt-in when upgrading your plan

We don't want you to miss out on the benefits of our serverless architecture. When you upgrade from the Free Tier to our Launch or Scale plans, you unlock the option to enable autoscaling. After your upgrade, we've made it easier for you to activate this feature:

### Fixes & improvements

- Added your current timezone to the **Restore branch** confirmation page, to make it a little easier to understand the timestamp you are restoring to.
- Scale plan users can now view database metrics for the past 14 days on the **Monitoring** page in the Neon Console. To try it out, go to the **Monitoring** page and select the **Last 14 days** item from the **Other** menu. Previously, metrics could only be viewed for the past 7 days.
- The **Database size** chart on the **Monitoring** page in the Neon Console now displays size information for up to 10 databases.
- Adjusted the functioning of the **Create support ticket** modal in the Neon Console to avoid automatically selecting **Branch** and **Compute** field values when opening the modal.
- Fixed an issue that prevented the **Autosuspend delay** option from being displayed on the **Edit compute endpoint** drawer in shared projects.
