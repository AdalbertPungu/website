### New Integrations: GitHub and Outerbase (bumped from last week)

This week we are featuring two new third-party integrations for your Neon project:

- GithHub &#8212;  Connect your Neon project to GitHub for streamlined workflows with GitHub Actions.
- Outerbase &&#8212; View, query, visualize, and edit your Neon data using AI-powered Outerbase.

### Added autoscaling opt-in when upgrading your plan

We don't want you to miss out on the benefits of our serverless architecture. When you upgrade from the Free Tier to our Launch or Scale plans, you unlock the option to enable autoscaling. After your upgrade, we've made it easier for you to activate this feature:

To learn more about autoscaling, [visit our autoscaling documentation](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/autoscaling).

### Computes, roles, and databases moved to branch pages in the Neon Console

You can now find your branch's computes, roles, and databases on the branch page they belong to. This update better reflects the relationship of these objects to their specific branches in a Neon project.

With this change, we also moved the compute endpoint delete option to the **Edit compute endpoint** drawer, which you can access by clicking **Edit** on the **Computes** tab.

For more information about how objects in a Neon project are organized and related, see [Overview of the Neon object hierarchy](/docs/manage/overview).
### [06/06] Support for pgvector 0.7.1

Neon now supports [pgvector](/docs/extensions/pgvector) version 0.7.1. This new version improves the performance of on-disk HNSW index builds.

For the official list of updates, refer to the [pgvector changelog](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

If you installed this extension previously and want to upgrade to the latest version, please refer to [Update an extension version](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions#update-an-extension-version) for instructions.

### Fixes & improvements

- Added your current timezone to the **Restore branch** confirmation page, to make it a little easier to understand the timestamp you are restoring to.

- Scale plan users can now view database metrics for the past 14 days on the **Monitoring** page in the Neon Console. To try it out, go to the **Monitoring** page and select the **Last 14 days** item from the **Other** menu. Previously, metrics could only be viewed for the past 7 days.
- The **Database size** chart on the **Monitoring** page in the Neon Console now displays size information for up to 10 databases.
- Adjusted the functioning of the **Create support ticket** modal in the Neon Console to avoid automatically selecting **Branch** and **Compute** field values when opening the modal.
- Fixed an issue that prevented the **Autosuspend delay** option from being displayed on the **Edit compute endpoint** drawer in shared projects. 
- [06/06] Fixed an issue with the dynamic rate limiter at the Neon Proxy that caused excessive CPU consumption and prevented new connections from being accepted.
