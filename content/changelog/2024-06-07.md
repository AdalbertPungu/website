### [06/06] Support for pgvector 0.7.1

Neon now supports [pgvector](/docs/extensions/pgvector) version 0.7.1. This new version improves the performance of on-disk HNSW index builds.

For the official list of updates, refer to the [pgvector changelog](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

If you installed this extension previously and want to upgrade to the latest version, please refer to [Update an extension version](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions#update-an-extension-version) for instructions.

### Fixes & improvements

- Scale plan users can now view database metrics for the past 14 days on the **Monitoring** page in the Neon Console. To try it out, go to the **Monitoring** page and select the **Last 14 days** item from the **Other** menu. Previously, metrics could only be viewed for the past 7 days.
- The **Database size** chart on the **Monitoring** page in the Neon Console now displays size information for up to 10 databases.
- Adjusted the functioning of the **Create support ticket** modal in the Neon Console to avoid automatically selecting **Branch** and **Compute** field values when opening the modal.
- Fixed an issue that prevented the **Autosuspend delay** option from being displayed on the **Edit compute endpoint** drawer in shared projects. 
- [06/06] Fixed an issue with the dynamic rate limiter at the Neon Proxy that caused excessive CPU consumption and prevented new connections from being accepted.
