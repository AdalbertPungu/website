### Branch restore with Time Travel assist

We are thrilled to announce the full launch of our Branch Restore feature with Time Travel Assist, now available for all users.

Using the new **Restore** page in the Neon Console, or the **branches restore** action in the Neon CLI, you can easily restore a branch to an earlier state in its own or another branch's history. From the **Restore** page in the Neon Console, you can also use Time Travel Assist to connect to a specific point in your history retention window, letting you run read-only queries against the point-in-time connection to pinpoint the exact moment you need to restore to, or perform other troubleshooting from your data's history.

Read more about the different types of restore operations available, as well as how to use Time Travel assist, on our documentation page for the feature: [Branch restore](/docs/guides/branch-restore). You can also follow along a sample restore from history operation in our blog post, [Announcing Point-in-Time Restore](https://neon.tech/blog/announcing-point-in-time-restore), or go for a deeper dive into the technical underpinnings of the feature in [Point In Time Recovery Under the Hood in Serverless Postgres](https://neon.tech/blog/point-in-time-recovery-in-postgres).

### New Pricing Plans

New pricing plans went into effect earlier this week. This was a significant change with a lot of effort behind the scenes and out front to get it right. We added two new pricing plans, Launch and Scale, bringing us to four different plans to choose from: Free Tier, Launch, Scale, and Enterprise. Visit our [Pricing](https://neon.tech/pricing) page to learn about the features, allowances, and pricing details for each plan. For an overview of how billing works for these plans, start [here](/docs/introduction/about-billing).

We know this is a big change. For a rationale about the thinking that went into it, read this blog post, [Making pricing more predictable](https://neon.tech/blog/making-pricing-more-predictable), by our co-founder, Stas Kelvich.

### Autoscaling graphs for better observability

Getting better visibility into how your compute scales up and down based on actual usage has been a highly requested feature for our paying users. As a step towards improving monitoring and observabiliy in the Neon Console, we are introducing a new Autoscaling graphs usage visualization tool, available now for all paying users with autoscaling enabled.

To access this view, open a branch from **Project &#8594; Branches**, or from the new **Branch &#8594; Overview** page, and edit the branch's **Compute**.

### New navigation in the Neon Console

We've also made big changes to how you find your way around your projects and branches in the Neon Console. First, we separated our sidebar links into easier-to-understand categories: **Project**, **Branch**, and **Resources**. You can find actions related to either Project or Branch under each label, with support options grouped under Resources.

We also added a more dynamic breadcrumb, with selectors letting you switch between projects and branches, depending on where you are in the Neon Console. This short clip shows you how the navigation works, as well as how to get to the new autoscaling graphs for a selected branch's compute.

Some other nice updates include:

- Added bold page titles to more easily identify which page you are on as you move through the Neon Console. If you click through to the **Operations** page or **Integrations** page for example, through whatever path you take to get there, you'll better know where you are.
- We've moved your profile avatar to the header of the page, giving you easier access to your account settings and API keys.

### Neon Vercel Integration improvements

The following changes were made to the [Neon Vercel Integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon):

- To ensure that users of the integration that access Neon from Vercel's serverless environment do not run out of connections, the `DATABASE_URL` and `PGHOST` environment variables added to a Vercel project by the Neon integration are now set to a pooled Neon connection string by default. Pooled connection strings use Neon's connection pooler, which supports up to 10,000 simultaneous connections. Previously, these variables were set to an unpooled Neon connection string which supports fewer concurrent connections.
- A new environment variable named `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` was added, which is set to the unpooled Neon connection string.
- STUB: changing env variables applied instantly instead of on the next git push for your app

For information about connection pooling in Neon and "pooled" vs "unpooled" connections strings, see [Connection pooling](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/connection-pooling).

### Fixes & improvements

- As part of the overall move to new pricing plans, the [history retention period](/docs/manage/projects#configure-history-retention) for Free Tier users is now 1 day. Previously, it was 7 days.
- Added new Grafbase and Outerbase cards to the Integrations page. If you're interested in either of these, head to the Integrations page and click **Request** to add your vote.
- STUB: Prisma URLs for DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED no longer need pgbroucer=true
- Various improvement to the SQL editor, including improved pagination for large result sets and the ability to cancel an in progress query using the Escape key.
- Fixed an issue with some Safari browser versions where disabled inputs were rendered invisible (instead of just greyed out).
- Reaching the max_connections limit now results in a human readable error message, with a suggestion to increase your maximum vCPU for the endpoint. Previously, the server just kept silently retrying the connection until timeout or a cancelation request.
- When creating a new project, items in the **Region** selector are now grouped by continent to make it easier to find individual regions.
- STUB: https://github.com/neondatabase/cloud/pull/10363
- Under **Account Settings**, you can now manage your password settings from a dedicated new **Password** section instead of from the **Profile** section.

### What's new in docs?

A new [Monitoring](/docs/introduction/monitoring) page that gives an overview of what kinds of monitoring and observability tools and features are available in Neon right now. Expect this page to get regular updates as we add more observability features.
