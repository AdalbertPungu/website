### Re-organized Integrations page

As our list of Integrations continues to grow, we've added categorized navigation, making it easier to explore what's offered. Click a category heading and then **Add** or **Request** the integrations you're interested in.

### Drizzle Studio Integration into Neon Console
We've integrated Drizzle Studio into the Neon Console, which lets you browse, add, update, and delete records from directly within the Neon Console. The Drizzle Studio integration also supports downloading data in `.json` and `.csv` file formats. You can access the Drizzle Studio integration from sidebar in the Neon console.

### Local File Cache (LFC) statistics and working set size function
You can now view Local File Cache (LFC) statistics for your Neon compute. The statistics include a cache hit ratio, which can help you determine if your data is being accessed from memory or the Neon storage layer.
The Local File Cache (LFC) is a layer of caching that stores frequently accessed data in the local memory of your Neon compute instance. The cache helps to reduce latency and improve query performance by minimizing the need to fetch data from the Neon storage layer. The LFC acts as an add-on or extension of Postgres [shared buffers](#shared-buffers). In Neon, the `shared_buffers` setting is always 128 MB, regardless of compute size. The LFC extends cache memory up to 50% of your compute's RAM.
Local File Cache (LFC) statistics are exposed through a `neon_stat_file_cache view`, which you access by installing the `neon` extension.
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION neon;
```
You can run the following query to view statistics:
```sql
SELECT * FROM neon.neon_stat_file_cache;
 file_cache_misses | file_cache_hits | file_cache_used | file_cache_writes | file_cache_hit_ratio
-------------------+-----------------+-----------------+-------------------+----------------------
           2133643 |       108999742 |             607 |          10767410 |                98.08
```
You can also use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` with the `FILECACHE` option to view LFC cache hit and miss data.
Additionally, the `neon` extension now provides an `approximate_working_set_size()` function that can be used to estimate your working set size. Ideally, your working set should fit in your compute's memory.
For more information, see [The neon extension](https://neon.tech/docs/extensions/neon). To learn how the LFC cache hit ratio and `approximate_working_set_size()` function can help you right-size your compute, see [How to size your compute](/docs/manage/endpoints#how-to-size-your-compute).

### PostgreSQL Partition Manager extension

We added support for the [pg_partman](https://github.com/pgpartman/pg_partman) Postgres extension, which lets you create and manage time-based and number-based table partition sets.


### Fixes & improvements

- The Consumption API endpoint is now fully available and no longer in Preview status. You can use this endpoint to get a full list of key consumption metrics for all the projects in your Neon account in a single API request. For more info:
    - [Consumption API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojectsconsumption)
    - [Retrieving metrics for all projects](/docs/guides/partner-billing#retrieving-metrics-for-all-projects) 
- You are now able to downgrade directly from **Scale** to **Launch** when that fits your usage needs. Previously, you needed to downgrade to Free tier first before then moving back up to Launch.
