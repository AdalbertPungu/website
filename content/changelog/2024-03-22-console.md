### Extra storage option for Neon's Launch plan

Based on customer feedback and requests, we’ve added an option to add extra storage to the Launch plan. If you require more than the 10 GiB storage allowance included with the Launch plan but aren’t ready for the Scale plan, you can now purchase additional storage in 2 GiB increments.

### Social accounts management 

Click your Profile in the top right corner. This change gives more visibility over the sign-in options and makes the change email paths more explicit and clear.

### Re-organized Integrations page

As our list of Integrations continues to grow, we've added categorized navigation, making it easier to explore what's offered. Click a category heading and then **Add** or **Request** the integrations you're interested in.

### Drizzle Studio Integration into Neon Console
We've integrated Drizzle Studio into the Neon Console, which lets you browse, add, update, and delete records from directly within the Neon Console. The Drizzle Studio integration also supports downloading data in `.json` and `.csv` file formats. You can access the Drizzle Studio integration from sidebar in the Neon console.

### Local File Cache (LFC) statistics and working set size function
You can now view Local File Cache (LFC) statistics for your Neon compute. The statistics include a cache hit ratio, which can help you determine if your data is being accessed from memory or the Neon storage layer.
The Local File Cache (LFC) is a layer of caching that stores frequently accessed data in the local memory of your Neon compute instance. The cache helps to reduce latency and improve query performance by minimizing the need to fetch data from the Neon storage layer. The LFC acts as an add-on or extension of Postgres [shared buffers](#shared-buffers). In Neon, the `shared_buffers` setting is always 128 MB, regardless of compute size. The LFC extends cache memory up to 50% of your compute's RAM.
Local File Cache (LFC) statistics are exposed through a `neon_stat_file_cache view`, which you access by installing the `neon` extension.
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION neon;
```
You can run the following query to view statistics:
```sql
SELECT * FROM neon.neon_stat_file_cache;
 file_cache_misses | file_cache_hits | file_cache_used | file_cache_writes | file_cache_hit_ratio
-------------------+-----------------+-----------------+-------------------+----------------------
           2133643 |       108999742 |             607 |          10767410 |                98.08
```
You can also use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` with the `FILECACHE` option to view LFC cache hit and miss data.
Additionally, the `neon` extension now provides an `approximate_working_set_size()` function that can be used to estimate your working set size. Ideally, your working set should fit in your compute's memory.
For more information, see [The neon extension](https://neon.tech/docs/extensions/neon). To learn how the LFC cache hit ratio and `approximate_working_set_size()` function can help you right-size your compute, see [How to size your compute](/docs/manage/endpoints#how-to-size-your-compute).

### PostgreSQL Partition Manager extension

We added support for the [pg_partman](https://github.com/pgpartman/pg_partman) Postgres extension, which lets you create and manage time-based and number-based table partition sets.

### Neon Vercel Integration enhancements

- Preview branches created by the Neon Vercel Integration now have a `/preview` prefix for the branch name. You can view your project's branches, including those created by the integration on the **Branches** page in the Neon Console. You can also view branches created by the integration from the Vercel integration drawer accessible from the Integration page in the Neon Console.
- Improved the sort order of preview branches listed in the Vercel integration drawer to list the most recently created branches first.
- Fixed an issue that marked the Vercel deployment status as successful while the preview deployment was still in progress.


### Fixes & improvements

- The Consumption API endpoint is now fully available and no longer in Preview status. You can use this endpoint to get a full list of key consumption metrics for all the projects in your Neon account in a single API request. For more info:
    - [Consumption API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojectsconsumption)
    - [Retrieving metrics for all projects](/docs/guides/partner-billing#retrieving-metrics-for-all-projects) 
- You are now able to downgrade directly from **Scale** to **Launch** when that fits your usage needs. Previously, you needed to downgrade to Free tier first before then moving back up to Launch.
- The Neon CLI now offers a Linux ARM64 binary, which you can find [here](https://github.com/neondatabase/neonctl/releases). For Neon CLI installation instructions, see [Neon CLI — Install and connect](/docs/reference/cli-install).
- Fixed the **Revoke access** confirmation modal shown when revoking access to a shared project. The modal appeared blank.
- Improved the form validation on the Neon **Sign Up** page.
- To improve the visibility of the Neon [project sharing](/docs/guides/project-sharing-guide) feature, available to all Neon users, we've added a **Sharing** button to the project dashboard, located in the top right corner next to your profile avatar.
- Changed the **Storage** label on the **Branches** widget on the project dashboard and **Branches** page to **Data size** to avoid confusion with the **Stoarge** label on the **Usage** widget. Data size refers to your logical data size (the size of your data on a branch). Storage is the data size plus history for your entire project. For more information about _Storage_ in Neon, see [Usage metrics](/docs/introduction/usage-metrics). 
- Added a new [Get URI](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getconnectionuri) API method that you can use to programmatically retrieve a database connection string. The Neon CLI also supports a command for constructing a database connection string. See [Neon CLI commands — connection-string](/docs/reference/cli-connection-string).

03/21
- Fixed an issue that prevented changing the email address for a Neon account.
- Corrected an issue with Neon CLI authorization for an unregistered user. After registering for a Neon account, the user was not directed back to the necessary page to complete the authorization.
