### Postgres version update

Supported Postgres versions were updated to [14.11](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.11/), [15.6](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/15.6/), and [16.2](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/16.2/), respectively.

### Fixes & improvements

- Fixed an issue that caused asterisk values used to mask passwords DATABASE_URL values to be displayed incorrectly in the Neon Vercel Integration.
- Production environment variables set by the Neon Vercel Integration are now updated if the Neon project's primary branch is changed.
- Corrected the default Postgres in the **Create project** modal and Neon API.
- Fixed an issue that caused an error page to be displayed when selecting **Settings** and then **Storage** in the Neon Console.
- Fixed an issue that prevented users from logging into the Neon Console. 
- The [Get projects](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojects) API now includes a `search` parameter that allows you to search for projects by the project name or id.
- You can now change the email associated with your account. See [changing your email](docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up#changing-your-email) for details.

### Neon serverless driver connection caching

Connection caching is now enabled by default at the Neon proxy for HTTP fetch queries. Connection caching provides server-side connection pooling so that a new connection does not have to be created for each query. Previously, this feature could only be enabled by setting an experimental `fetchConnectionCache` option to `true` in your serverless driver connection configuration. If you currently specify this option, you can now remove it. The server-side connection cache works with both pooled and unpooled connections.

### What's new in docs?

We have a couple of new guides for you to check out this week:

- Learn how to connect a Neon Postgres database from [Cloudflare Workers](/docs/guides/cloudflare-workers).
- Learn how you can preload data into your database cache with the [pg_prewarm extension](/docs/extensions/pg_prewarm).

Explore our recently added [Reset branch from parent](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/branches#reset-a-branch-from-parent) documentation to discover how to update your working branch with the most recent updates from your main branch.
