### Change the email associated with your account

We've added the ability to change the email associated with your account. For example, if you previously signed up using a work-based social account and now want to use your personal email, you can make this change under **Profile → Account Settings → Personal Information** or using this direct link: [change email](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/profile?modal=change_email).

See [Changing your email](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up#changing-your-email) for details.

### Fixes & improvements

### What's new in docs?

We have a couple of new guides for you to check out this week:

- Learn how to connect a Neon Postgres database from [Cloudflare Workers](/docs/guides/cloudflare-workers).
- Learn how you can preload data into your database cache with the [pg_prewarm extension](/docs/extensions/pg_prewarm).

Explore our recently added [Reset branch from parent](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/branches#reset-a-branch-from-parent) documentation to discover how to update your working branch with the most recent updates from your main branch. For a more visual guide, see this [video from Neon DevRel on X](https://twitter.com/neondatabase/status/1735350288288993690).
