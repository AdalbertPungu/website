### What's new

- Integrations: You can now integrate Neon with your Vercel project directly from your Vercel account. The new Neon integration, which is currently in Beta, is available in the [Vercel Integration Marketplace](https://vercel.com/integrations). The integration allows you to connect your Vercel project to a new or existing Neon project. It also enables creating database branch with each Vercel preview deployment and creating a development branch for your Vercel development environment. For more information, see [Connect Vercel and Neon](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/vercel).
- Control plane: Added the ability to enforce the use of connection pooling by adding a `-pooler` suffix to the connection hostname.
- UI: Endpoints were removed from the **Project limits** widget on the dashboard.

### Bug fixes

- Console: Added validation for user emails provided when signing up for Neon.
- Control Plane: Added validation for the Log Sequence Number (LSN) provided when creating a branch from a particular LSN value. A proper error is now reported when an invalid LSN value is provided.
